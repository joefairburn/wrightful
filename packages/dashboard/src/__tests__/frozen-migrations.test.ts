/**
 * Guard against accidental edits to `0000_init` in either ControlDO or
 * TenantDO migrations. Both DOs apply migrations on first request via rwsdk's
 * lazy-init pattern; once `0000_init` runs in production it is frozen
 * forever — schema changes must go in NEW numbered migrations, never as
 * edits to a migration that has already been applied somewhere.
 *
 * If you genuinely need to change something `0000_init` declares, the right
 * answer is a new `000N_*` migration that ALTERs / DROPs / re-creates as
 * needed. Update the expected hash here only after you've added the
 * follow-up migration that compensates for the diff — don't pretend nothing
 * happened.
