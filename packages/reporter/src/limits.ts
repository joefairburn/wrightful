/**
 * Client-side payload caps + truncation.
 *
 * The dashboard hard-REJECTS an oversized `title` (identity field) and would 400
 * the whole open/`/results` call; and although it truncates free-form
 * `errorMessage`/`errorStack`/annotation `description` server-side, a
 * multi-megabyte assertion diff can 413 the whole request body BEFORE it's
 * parsed. Both failures lose real test results non-retryably. So the reporter
 * clamps these fields itself, mirroring the dashboard caps.
 *
 * These constants MIRROR the dashboard's `MAX` (`apps/dashboard/src/lib/schemas.ts`)
 * — the reporter must not take a runtime dependency on the dashboard package, so
 * `contract.test.ts` pins them against the dashboard's exported `MAX` (a cap the
 * dashboard tightens without the reporter tracking it would otherwise surface
 * only as a production 400/413).

 * an array that decodes to the empty string) so the wire carries an explicit
 * `null` rather than `""` — the dashboard column is nullable and the two
 * surfaces (reporter + Zod schema) agree on "no output === null".
 *
 * `Buffer` chunks are decoded via one `StringDecoder("utf8")` shared across the
 * array: Playwright can split a UTF-8 codepoint across two chunks at any byte
 * boundary, and per-chunk `toString("utf8")` would mangle the split into
 * replacement chars — the decoder carries incomplete trailing bytes to the next
 * chunk. Already-string chunks pass through. Chunks join in emission order with
 * no separator (Playwright's chunks carry their own newlines). Accumulation
 * stops once output reaches `max` so a runaway `console.log` can't balloon the
