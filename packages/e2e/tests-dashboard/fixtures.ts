 * Custom Playwright test extended with our project-specific fixtures.
 *
 * Specs that need the seeded user/team/project metadata declare
 * `async ({ ctx, runsListPage })` and Playwright wires it up. The
 * `ctx` fixture is a thin alias over the JSON file written by
 * global-setup; it's a worker-scoped read so we don't re-parse the
 * file once per test.
 *
 * Page objects are test-scoped (one fresh instance per test) — they
 * close over `page`, which Playwright resets between tests.
