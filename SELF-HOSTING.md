# Self-hosting Wrightful

Wrightful's dashboard is a [Void](https://void.cloud) app that runs on Cloudflare Workers: one Worker for the dashboard + ingest API, one **Postgres** database (auth, tenancy, runs, and test data) reached over **Cloudflare Hyperdrive**, and one R2 bucket for artifact bytes. You bring your own Postgres — [Neon](https://neon.tech) has a free tier that's ample for self-hosting, and [PlanetScale Postgres](https://planetscale.com) is a good scale-up. The R2 binding `STORAGE` and the `HYPERDRIVE` (Postgres) binding are the only data bindings — no KV. Synthetic monitoring (optional) adds two Cloudflare **Queues** (`monitors`, `uptime`) and, for **browser** monitors, a **Sandbox container**; five rate-limiter bindings ship in `wrangler.jsonc`. See [Synthetic monitors](#synthetic-monitors-optional) for what a self-hoster needs to provision (HTTP/TCP monitors need only the queues; browser monitors need the container — or set `WRIGHTFUL_MONITOR_EXECUTOR=stub` to skip both).

There are two ways to deploy:

- **[Deploy to your own Cloudflare account](#recommended-deploy-to-your-own-cloudflare-account) (recommended)** — `wrangler deploy` against a Postgres database (reached over Hyperdrive) + an R2 bucket you create. The build output is a standard Cloudflare Worker, so this is the most predictable, production-ready path today.
- **[One-command deploy with Void](#alternative-one-command-deploy-with-void-still-early) (simpler, still early)** — `void deploy` ships to Void's managed Cloudflare platform and auto-provisions everything with no Cloudflare account. The platform is young, so prefer the Cloudflare path above for anything you depend on.

Both produce the same Worker from the same checked-in migrations.

---

## Recommended: deploy to your own Cloudflare account

Prerequisites: Node 20+, `pnpm`, a Cloudflare account, and `wrangler` (`npm i -g wrangler`, then `wrangler login`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/wrightful.git
cd wrightful
pnpm install
cd apps/dashboard          # the wrangler/build steps below run from here
```

### 1. Provision Postgres + create the Cloudflare resources

You need a Postgres database, a Hyperdrive config that points at it, and an R2 bucket. Provision the Postgres database first — [Neon](https://neon.tech) (free tier) is the easy default; [PlanetScale Postgres](https://planetscale.com) or any other Postgres works too — and copy its connection string. Then create the Hyperdrive config (the runtime path to that Postgres) and the bucket:

```bash
# A Hyperdrive config over your Postgres — prints a config id; keep it for step 2.
wrangler hyperdrive create wrightful-pg --connection-string="postgres://USER:PASS@HOST/DB?sslmode=require"
wrangler r2 bucket create wrightful-artifacts
```

### 2. Point Wrangler at your resources (via `CF_*` env vars)

**You do not hand-edit `wrangler.jsonc`.** It's gitignored and generated from the committed `apps/dashboard/wrangler.template.jsonc` by `scripts/gen-wrangler.mjs`, which injects your deployment IDs from `CF_*` env vars and materializes `wrangler.jsonc` in the dev/build/deploy pre-hooks (the same generated-from-committed-sources pattern as `db/migrations/`). So no account-specific IDs are ever committed.

One time only, drop any locally-tracked copy so the generator owns it:

```bash
git rm --cached apps/dashboard/wrangler.jsonc   # if it's still tracked in your clone
```

Then set these as env vars (in `apps/dashboard/.env.local` for local dev, or as build vars in CI — see [Auto-deploy on push](#auto-deploy-on-push-recommended)):

```bash
# The Worker name (any name you like).
CF_WORKER_NAME=wrightful-dashboard-void
# The R2 bucket from step 1 (→ STORAGE binding).
CF_R2_BUCKET=wrightful-artifacts
# From `wrangler hyperdrive create` in step 1 (→ HYPERDRIVE binding).
CF_HYPERDRIVE_ID=<config id from step 1>
```

`gen-wrangler` injects a `hyperdrive[HYPERDRIVE]` block from `CF_HYPERDRIVE_ID` plus an `r2_buckets[STORAGE]` block from `CF_R2_BUCKET`. The rate-limiter bindings and Void's `main`/`assets`/`migrations` are handled by the template + plugin — you don't touch those.

At runtime the Worker reaches Postgres through Hyperdrive (the `HYPERDRIVE` binding). **Local dev and migrations connect directly** via a `DATABASE_URL` instead (Hyperdrive is runtime-only) — set that in `apps/dashboard/.env.local`:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASS@HOST:5432/DB?sslmode=require
```

### 3. Apply migrations to the remote database

`pnpm db:migrate:remote` applies the committed `db/migrations/` to your remote/prod Postgres over `$DATABASE_URL` — the **direct** connection, since Hyperdrive is runtime-only and can't be used for migrations:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASS@HOST:5432/DB?sslmode=require   pnpm db:migrate:remote
```

### 4. Build and deploy

```bash
pnpm deploy:cf      # = vp build && wrangler deploy; prints your https://<worker>.<subdomain>.workers.dev URL
```

`vp build` runs the Cloudflare Vite plugin, which writes `dist/wrangler.json` (your real IDs + Void's `main`/`assets`/triggers) plus a `.wrangler/deploy/config.json` redirect; `wrangler deploy` reads that redirect so it ships the built output rather than re-reading the source `wrangler.jsonc`.

### 5. Set secrets

`wrangler secret put` applies to the live Worker immediately (no redeploy needed). Until they're set the dashboard 500s on sign-in pages — that's expected on first deploy.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32 | wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
wrangler secret put WRIGHTFUL_PUBLIC_URL     # paste the URL wrangler printed in step 4
```

Use the `workers.dev` URL from step 4, or a [custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/) you map to the Worker. See [Environment variables](#environment-variables) for the optional keys (GitHub OAuth, open signup, etc.), then jump to [Sign up + wire up the reporter](#sign-up--wire-up-the-reporter).

### Updating

```bash
git pull origin main
pnpm install
cd apps/dashboard
pnpm db:migrate:remote   # apply any new migrations first (see step 3)
pnpm deploy:cf
```

### Auto-deploy on push (recommended)

The recommended CD path is **[Cloudflare Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/)** — connect the repo once and Cloudflare builds + deploys on push, with previews for non-production branches. Connect your repo under the Worker's **Settings → Builds**, then configure:

- **Root directory:** `apps/dashboard`
- **Build command:** `pnpm build`
- **Production deploy command:** `pnpm db:migrate:remote && npx wrangler deploy`
- **Non-production deploy command:** `npx wrangler versions upload` (no migration)

The migration runs in the **production** deploy command only — the build runs for every branch (including preview branches), so you don't want every preview mutating your prod schema. Non-prod branches upload a version without migrating.

Set the deployment IDs as build **variables** (`CF_WORKER_NAME`, `CF_R2_BUCKET`, `CF_HYPERDRIVE_ID`), and `DATABASE_URL` (your prod Postgres **direct** connection) as a build **secret**. The build environment runs `gen-wrangler` (via the `prebuild` hook) and the migration, so **your prod database must be reachable from Cloudflare's build environment** for `db:migrate:remote` to apply. Runtime app secrets (`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `WRIGHTFUL_PUBLIC_URL`, …) are set separately as Worker secrets (`wrangler secret put`) and persist across deploys.

> **Migration safety (expand/contract).** Migrate-before-deploy is safe for **additive** ("expand") migrations: if the deploy fails after the migration, the old code keeps serving on the new schema — just re-run. **Destructive ("contract") changes** — dropping a column the live code still reads — must ship in a **later** deploy, once no running version depends on the old shape. Migrations are forward-only and tracked, so each runs once.

<summary>GitHub Actions alternative</summary>

If you'd rather run CD from Actions, add `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Workers Scripts + R2 edit scopes) and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, plus `DATABASE_URL` (your prod Postgres direct connection), as repo secrets:

```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
      CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
      # CF_WORKER_NAME / CF_R2_BUCKET / CF_HYPERDRIVE_ID / DATABASE_URL as needed
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: "22", cache: "pnpm" }
      - run: pnpm install
      - working-directory: apps/dashboard
        run: |
          pnpm db:migrate:remote
          pnpm deploy:cf
```

</details>

## Alternative: one-command deploy with Void (still early)

> Void's managed deploy provisions Postgres (over Hyperdrive) + R2 and applies migrations in a single command with **no Cloudflare account** — handy for a quick throwaway or preview instance. The platform is still early, so for anything you rely on, prefer the [Cloudflare path](#recommended-deploy-to-your-own-cloudflare-account) above.

Prerequisites: Node 20+, `pnpm`, a Void account.

```bash
pnpm install

# 1. Authenticate + link a Void project (interactive). Saves .void/project.json.
pnpm --filter @wrightful/dashboard exec void auth login

# 2. Set secrets (remote secrets persist across deploys).
openssl rand -base64 32 | pnpm --filter @wrightful/dashboard exec void secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
pnpm --filter @wrightful/dashboard exec void secret put WRIGHTFUL_PUBLIC_URL

# 3. Deploy — builds, applies db/migrations/, provisions Postgres + R2, goes live.
pnpm deploy
```

`pnpm deploy` runs `void deploy`, which reads the checked-in `apps/dashboard/db/migrations/`, fails if the schema source (`db/schema.ts`) has drifted ahead of them (run `pnpm db:generate`, commit, retry), applies any pending migrations, and goes live — no separate migrate step, no hand-edited binding config. For auto-deploy on push, `void init --github` writes a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that runs `void deploy` with a `VOID_TOKEN` secret (from `void auth token`).

---

## Environment variables

Every key is declared and validated in `apps/dashboard/env.ts`. For local dev, copy `apps/dashboard/.env.example` to `apps/dashboard/.env.local` and fill it in. For production, set values as secrets — `wrangler secret put NAME` (Cloudflare path) or `void secret put NAME` (Void path). A missing required key 500s the dashboard at runtime; `void deploy` additionally hard-errors before upload.

**Required:**

- `WRIGHTFUL_PUBLIC_URL` — the public origin users hit (e.g. `https://wrightful-dashboard-void.<you>.workers.dev` or a custom domain). Used by Better Auth for OAuth callbacks and for the artifact-download token audience.
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` — 32+ random bytes (`openssl rand -base64 32`). Signs session cookies and artifact download tokens. (On Void's managed platform this is auto-created if unset.)

**Optional:**

- `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` — enable "Continue with GitHub". Register an [OAuth app](https://github.com/settings/developers) with callback `${WRIGHTFUL_PUBLIC_URL}/api/auth/callback/github`. Both must be set or the button stays hidden.
- `ALLOW_OPEN_SIGNUP` (`true`/`false`, default `false`) — allow anyone to register. Off by default; on a public instance, pair it with `EMAIL_FROM` so new registrations must verify their address before signing in. Left off, add users via invites.
- `EMAIL_FROM` — From address for outbound email (account verification, password reset, monitor alerts), e.g. `Wrightful <noreply@mail.example.com>`. Sent via the Cloudflare Email Service (CES) `EMAIL` binding, so the address must live on a domain you've [onboarded to CES](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/) (CES provisions SPF/DKIM/DMARC). CES sending needs a Workers Paid plan and is in public beta. **Optional** — leave it unset and all email features stay off and degrade gracefully: signup needs no verification, the password-reset page reports email isn't configured, and monitor alerts are skipped.
- `ARTIFACT_TOKEN_SECRET` — optional dedicated signer for the short-lived artifact-download tokens. Defaults to `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`; set a separate value to revoke leaked artifact links by rotating it, without invalidating every user session.
- `REALTIME_INTERNAL_SECRET` — pins the secret that authenticates the dashboard's internal realtime broadcasts (ingest worker → WebSocket room). Defaults to a fresh random value baked into each build; see [Production notes](#production-notes) for why you may want to pin it.

### GitHub Checks (PR commit status)

Posts a check run on a PR's head commit reflecting the run outcome. **All-or-nothing**: enabled only when `GITHUB_APP_ID` + `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` + `GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are all set. This is a GitHub **App** (mints an installation token that works on fork PRs) — distinct from the `AUTH_GITHUB_*` OAuth creds used for sign-in.

| Name                        | Required?  | Default | Purpose                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID`             | For Checks | —       | GitHub App id.                                                                                                                                           |
| `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`    | For Checks | —       | App private key, **PKCS#8** PEM (`BEGIN PRIVATE KEY`). Convert GitHub's PKCS#1: `openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in key.pem`.                             |
| `GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | For Checks | —       | Verifies inbound App webhooks (installation / check-run).                                                                                                |
| `GITHUB_APP_SLUG`           | No         | —       | The App's public slug (`github.com/apps/<slug>`). Drives the one-click "Install" button on team settings; without it the page shows manual instructions. |

### Usage quotas

Bind only for teams on the `free` tier (other tiers are unlimited). Runs + artifact-bytes are **hard-blocked** at the limit; test-results is metered + soft-warned only. To run an instance with no limits, leave teams off the free tier (or raise these).

| Name                                  | Default | Purpose                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WRIGHTFUL_FREE_MONTHLY_RUNS`         | 1000    | Free-tier monthly run-open allowance (hard block on `POST /api/runs`).       |
| `WRIGHTFUL_FREE_MONTHLY_TEST_RESULTS` | 100000  | Free-tier monthly test-result allowance (soft-warn only, not blocked).       |
| `WRIGHTFUL_FREE_ARTIFACT_BYTES`       | 5 GiB   | Free-tier monthly artifact-byte allowance (hard block on fresh bytes).       |
| `WRIGHTFUL_QUOTA_SOFT_WARN_PCT`       | 90      | Percent of a limit at which the ingest response warns before the 100% block. |

### Data retention

Two independent axes (artifact bytes vs. test-result rows) swept by the `sweep-retention` cron. These are instance-wide defaults; a team can override its own windows in team settings. **Invariant:** `WRIGHTFUL_RETENTION_ARTIFACT_DAYS` ≤ `WRIGHTFUL_RETENTION_TEST_RESULTS_DAYS`.

| Name                                    | Default | Purpose                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WRIGHTFUL_RETENTION_ARTIFACT_DAYS`     | 30      | Age after which artifact R2 objects + rows are swept.                                    |
| `WRIGHTFUL_RETENTION_TEST_RESULTS_DAYS` | 90      | Age after which `testResults` rows (+ cascaded children) are swept (run summaries kept). |
| `WRIGHTFUL_RETENTION_SWEEP_BATCH_SIZE`  | 200     | Max rows per axis per project per cron pass (drains across passes).                      |

### Data export / query API

| Name                        | Default | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WRIGHTFUL_EXPORT_MAX_ROWS` | 50000   | Hard cap on rows a single CSV export streams (`/api/v1/*?format=csv`, `/api/t/.../export/*`). Past it, the response sets `X-Wrightful-Export-Truncated: true` rather than silently truncating. |

The Bearer-authed read/query API lives under `/api/v1/*` (rate-limited via the `QUERY` limiter). See [`docs/api/query-export.md`](./docs/api/query-export.md).

### Synthetic monitors (optional)

Scheduled browser / HTTP / TCP·ping checks. The `sweep-monitors` cron enqueues due monitors to the `monitors` (browser) / `uptime` (http·tcp) Queues; the consumers run them via the configured executor. **HTTP/TCP monitors** need only the two Queues (plain `fetch()` / `connect()` — no container). **Browser monitors** additionally need a Sandbox container running the user's Playwright. To skip synthetic monitoring entirely in production, set `WRIGHTFUL_MONITOR_EXECUTOR` accordingly and don't create browser monitors.

Container provisioning on the Cloudflare path: build `apps/dashboard/Dockerfile.sandbox`, push it to a registry, and replace the `REPLACE_WITH_REGISTRY/wrightful-sandbox:latest` placeholder in `apps/dashboard/void.json`'s `sandbox` block. Queue creation + container wiring follow Void's [Cloudflare integration guide](https://void.cloud/integrations/cloudflare). On the Void managed path these are provisioned automatically.

| Name                                        | Default   | Purpose                                                                                     |

| `WRIGHTFUL_MONITOR_EXECUTOR`                | `sandbox` | `sandbox` (Void Sandbox container) or `stub` (in-process synthetic run; dev/CI, no Docker). |
| `WRIGHTFUL_MONITOR_MAX_PER_PROJECT`         | 25        | Per-project cap on **browser** monitors (each multiplies container runs).                   |
| `WRIGHTFUL_HTTP_MONITOR_MAX_PER_PROJECT`    | 50        | Per-project cap on HTTP (uptime) monitors.                                                  |
| `WRIGHTFUL_TCP_MONITOR_MAX_PER_PROJECT`     | 50        | Per-project cap on TCP/ping monitors.                                                       |
| `WRIGHTFUL_HTTP_CHECK_MAX_BODY_BYTES`       | 256 KiB   | Max response-body bytes buffered for an HTTP body/JSON assertion.                           |
| `WRIGHTFUL_MONITOR_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS`    | 300       | Hard per-execution wall-clock cap for a browser run.                                        |
| `WRIGHTFUL_MONITOR_EXECUTION_STALE_MINUTES` | 30        | Minutes a `queued`/`running` execution can sit before the reaper marks it `error`.          |
| `WRIGHTFUL_MONITOR_SWEEP_BATCH_SIZE`        | 200       | Max due monitors the sweep cron enqueues per invocation.                                    |

## Production notes

**Pin `REALTIME_INTERNAL_SECRET`** — the worker authenticates its internal realtime broadcasts (run/project live updates) with a secret that, by default, is a fresh random value baked into each build. During a rolling deploy, the old and new versions briefly hold different secrets, so cross-version broadcasts are rejected (a logged 403). This is non-fatal — the data is already in the database and live views catch up on reload — but if you deploy often and care about uninterrupted live updates, set a stable value once: `openssl rand -base64 32 | wrangler secret put REALTIME_INTERNAL_SECRET` (or `void secret put` on the Void path).

**Rate limiting needs a trusted client-IP header** — the auth/API rate limiters key unauthenticated requests by `CF-Connecting-IP`, falling back to the first hop of `X-Forwarded-For`. When the Worker runs on Cloudflare (both deploy paths above), `CF-Connecting-IP` is always set by the edge and cannot be spoofed. If you front the instance with anything else — or proxy to it through your own infrastructure — note that `X-Forwarded-For` is client-controlled: a sender can rotate it freely to dodge per-IP limits. Make sure your edge sets `CF-Connecting-IP` (or strips and rewrites `X-Forwarded-For`) from the real client address before the request reaches the Worker.

**What "closed signup" actually closes** — with `ALLOW_OPEN_SIGNUP=false`, email/password registration is disabled, but GitHub OAuth sign-in (when configured) can still create accounts. That is deliberate: invites don't create accounts, so OAuth signup is how an invited teammate gets one on a closed instance. The resource boundary is enforced one step later — a self-registered account with no team membership cannot **create a team** (and therefore can't reach projects, API keys, or synthetic monitors). The only exception is a fresh instance with zero teams, so the first user — you — can bootstrap. Existing members can always create additional teams.

**Features fail closed when unconfigured** — these shipped surfaces silently no-op (rather than erroring) until configured, so an unconfigured instance is fine: GitHub Checks are skipped unless the three `GITHUB_APP_*` secrets are set (the `/api/github/webhook` 404s otherwise); browser monitors error at execution if `WRIGHTFUL_MONITOR_EXECUTOR=sandbox` but no container is wired (HTTP/TCP monitors still work); usage quotas only bind for `free`-tier teams.

**Email is optional (`EMAIL_FROM`)** — account verification, password reset, and monitor down/recovery alerts only send when `EMAIL_FROM` is set and its domain is onboarded to Cloudflare Email Service. Without it the dashboard runs normally: signup skips verification (so a public instance with open signup but no email lets anyone in unverified — set `EMAIL_FROM` for public instances), the password-reset page reports that email isn't configured, and monitor alerts are silently skipped. In local `vp dev` the send is **simulated** — logged to the console with the rendered HTML/text written to a temp file — so you never send real mail while developing.

**Retention is destructive + invariant-checked** — the `sweep-retention` cron permanently deletes aged artifact bytes and test-result rows. Keep `WRIGHTFUL_RETENTION_ARTIFACT_DAYS` ≤ `WRIGHTFUL_RETENTION_TEST_RESULTS_DAYS` (artifacts are the costly axis, swept sooner). Both are instance defaults; teams can widen/narrow their own windows in settings.

## Sign up + wire up the reporter

Open your `WRIGHTFUL_PUBLIC_URL` in a browser.

1. **Sign up** with email/password (or GitHub if configured). Set `ALLOW_OPEN_SIGNUP=true` first if you're the first user, then turn it off.
2. Create a team via `/settings/teams/new`.
3. Create a project via `/settings/teams/<team-slug>/projects/new`.
4. Generate an API key from the project's keys page (`/settings/teams/<team-slug>/p/<project-slug>/keys`). Save the printed key — only its SHA-256 hash is stored server-side.

In your Playwright project's CI, set:

```bash
WRIGHTFUL_URL=https://<your-dashboard-origin>
WRIGHTFUL_TOKEN=<the key from step 4>
```

Then install the reporter:

```bash
pnpm add -D @wrightful/reporter
```

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [["list"], ["@wrightful/reporter"]],
});
```

Results stream to your dashboard as tests run.

## Troubleshooting

**First load 500s on sign-in pages** — `WRIGHTFUL_PUBLIC_URL` or `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` isn't set. List what's set with `wrangler secret list` (or `void env check --remote` on the Void path); tail runtime logs with `wrangler tail` (or `void project logs --level error`).

**Schema drift on build/deploy** — the schema source (`db/schema.ts`) is ahead of the committed migrations. Run `pnpm db:generate` (= `void db generate`), review the new files under `db/migrations/`, and commit them. On the Cloudflare path, re-apply with `pnpm db:migrate:remote` then redeploy; `void deploy` applies pending migrations itself.

**Migration discipline** — schema changes are forward-only / additive (new tables, new nullable columns). Generate a new numbered migration with `pnpm db:generate` (from `db/schema.ts`); never edit a migration that has already been applied to a live database.

**"Continue with GitHub" doesn't appear** — both `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` must be set; the button is gated on both being present. The provider is enabled in `apps/dashboard/auth.ts` at startup when those creds exist — it is deliberately **not** declared in `apps/dashboard/void.json`'s `auth.providers` (which lists only `email`), because declaring it there would make Void hard-require the GitHub creds on every deploy.

**Artifacts fail to upload** — confirm the `STORAGE` (R2) binding resolved. On the Cloudflare path that means `CF_R2_BUCKET` was set so `gen-wrangler` injected the `r2_buckets` block into the generated `wrangler.jsonc` with a real `bucket_name`; tail logs with `wrangler tail`. Per-artifact size is capped by `WRIGHTFUL_MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES` (default 50 MiB).

## What's under the hood

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full architecture overview (Postgres over Hyperdrive + Drizzle, logical tenancy, R2 artifact storage, `void/ws` realtime rooms, the streaming ingest protocol, and the cron/queue background work). For the exact binding-merge semantics on the Cloudflare path, see the Void [Cloudflare integration guide](https://void.cloud/integrations/cloudflare#deploy-to-your-own-cloudflare-account).
