# Sticky GitHub PR comment (App-posted run summary)

## What changed

The dashboard now upserts a single **sticky PR comment** for every completed
run that carries a `repo` + `prNumber`, alongside the existing check run. Check
runs are easy to miss in the PR UI; the comment is the summary teams actually
read. It renders:

- the check-run-parity headline + passed/failed/flaky/skipped/duration table;
- failures split **new vs. known** — new = failing here but passing/absent on
  the branch's previous terminal run, known = already failing there;
- **flaky detections** for this run (passed only after retry);
- deep links: each listed test → its test-result page, plus "View run report"
  and (when a baseline exists) "Compare to base" (`…/runs/:id/diff`);
- capped at 10 lines per section with an "…and N more" overflow.

New module `apps/dashboard/src/lib/github-pr-comment.ts`
(`maybePostGithubPrComment(runId, projectId)`), called best-effort (never
throws) from the same three terminal ingest paths as `maybePostGithubCheck`:
`completeRun`, `completeShardedRun` (only when all shards are done), and
`finalizeStaleRun`.

## Why dashboard-side / design notes

- Same rationale as the check run (`github-checks.ts` module doc): installation
  tokens work on fork PRs, the dashboard owns the authoritative aggregates, and
  watchdog-finalized runs never reach reporter `onEnd`. The reporter's
  CI-token `postPrComment` stays as the no-App fallback; distinct markers, so
  running both stacks two comments — SELF-HOSTING now says pick one.
- **Sticky identity is per PR, not per run** — new table `githubPrComments`
  keyed unique `(projectId, repo, prNumber)` storing the GitHub comment id.
  The DB row (not a marker scan) locates the comment; the
  `<!-- wrightful:pr-summary:<projectId> -->` marker is for human debugging and
  project disambiguation.
- **Race safety** mirrors the check-run claim: `claimedAt` claim-before-POST
  CAS (120s TTL) so concurrent completions of the same run never stack
  duplicate comments; POST failure releases the claim; PATCH 404 (a human
  deleted the comment) reposts fresh.
- **Stale-run guard**: `githubPrComments.runId` records which run the comment
  renders; run ids are ULIDs (time-ordered), so a watchdog finalizing an old
  push late declines instead of regressing the comment to stale content.
- **Baseline choice**: NOT `resolveBaseRun` (the diff page's last-_passed_
  anchor) — a passed baseline contains no failing rows, so "known failures"
  could never be non-empty. The comment resolves the most recent **terminal**
  run on the same branch (`resolveCommentBaseRun`) and feeds the existing pure
  `diffRuns` via `computeRunDiff`. Failing `addedTests` count as new failures.
  First run on a PR branch has no baseline → a single un-split "Failures"
  section. Possible future upgrade: diff against the PR's _target_ branch
  (needs the target branch, which ingest doesn't capture today).
- Tenancy: same confused-deputy boundary as checks — the installation lookup is
  scoped to the run's own `teamId`, never resolved from the attacker-controlled
  `repo` owner alone. The `TenantScope` for the diff queries is built from the
  trusted joined run row (same rationale as `finalizeStaleRun`).
- The GitHub App now needs **Pull requests: Read & write** (comments go through
  the issues API with an installation token). Without it the POST 403s — logged
  via `logger.error`, ingest unaffected.

## Migration

`20260717214015_nosy_daimon_hellstrom.sql` — creates `githubPrComments` with
FKs (`projectId` cascade, `runId` set-null) and the unique
`(projectId, repo, prNumber)` index.

## Files

- `apps/dashboard/src/lib/github-pr-comment.ts` — new (render + claim + post).
- `apps/dashboard/db/schema.ts` — `githubPrComments` table.
- `apps/dashboard/src/lib/github-checks.ts` — exported `formatDuration`.
- `apps/dashboard/src/lib/ingest.ts` — three call sites.
- `apps/dashboard/src/__tests__/github-pr-comment.workers.test.ts` — pure
  rendering/bucketing/path tests.
- `apps/dashboard/src/__tests__/github-pr-comment-claim.test.ts` — pglite
  integration: first-POST persist, PATCH + new-vs-known content end-to-end,
  claim race (exactly one POST), claim release on failure, stale-run guard,
  PATCH-404 repost, tenancy no-ops.
- `SELF-HOSTING.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — App permission + table docs.

## Verification

- `pnpm --filter @wrightful/dashboard test` — both lanes green (includes the
  20 new tests).
- `pnpm check` and `pnpm --filter @wrightful/dashboard typecheck` — clean.

## Follow-up: dedupe the check-run / PR-comment surfaces

A code-quality review found `github-pr-comment.ts` had been written by cloning
`github-checks.ts` rather than sharing with it. Refactored, intending zero
behavior change beyond two explicitly-accepted timing simplifications (below):

- **Shared run-surface orchestrator.** New `apps/dashboard/src/lib/
github-run-context.ts` resolves everything BOTH surfaces need for a
  completed run in one pass: the run row (a superset join of `runs` +
  `teams` + `projects` covering both surfaces' fields, including
  `prNumber`/`branch`/`createdAt`), `parseRepoOwner`, the team-scoped
  `githubInstallations` lookup (the confused-deputy authorization boundary —
  its full rationale comment now lives here, the single enforcement site),
  and a minted installation token — as `resolveGithubRunContext(runId,
projectId): Promise<GithubRunContext | null>`. New
  `apps/dashboard/src/lib/github-run-surfaces.ts` exports the single entry
  point `postGithubRunSurfaces(runId, projectId)` that resolves this context
  once and posts both surfaces via `Promise.all`; `ingest.ts`'s three call
  sites (`completeRun`, `completeShardedRun`, `finalizeStaleRun`) now make one
  awaited call each instead of two sequential ones.
  - Context resolution and the orchestrator are split across TWO files (not
    one) specifically to keep the module graph a DAG: `github-checks.ts` and
    `github-pr-comment.ts` each import `resolveGithubRunContext` from the leaf
    `github-run-context.ts` for their own standalone `maybePostGithubCheck` /
    `maybePostGithubPrComment` entry points, and `github-run-surfaces.ts`
    imports from all three. Folding context resolution into
    `github-run-surfaces.ts` alongside the orchestrator would have made
    `github-checks.ts` and `github-pr-comment.ts` import FROM it while it
    imports THEIR `post*Surface` functions — a cycle oxlint's `import(no-cycle)`
    correctly flags as a hard error.
  - `github-checks.ts` / `github-pr-comment.ts` were refactored into
    `postCheckRunSurface(context)` / `postPrCommentSurface(context)` (the
    claim-before-POST logic, render, and POST/PATCH target — genuinely each
    surface's own, unchanged) plus thin `maybePostGithubCheck` /
    `maybePostGithubPrComment(runId, projectId)` wrappers that resolve context
    and delegate — kept at their original names/signatures for the existing
    claim-concurrency tests and any future standalone caller. Each surface
    keeps its OWN try/catch + `logger.error` envelope, so a check-run failure
    never suppresses the PR comment or vice versa.
  - **Accepted behavior changes** (both from minting once instead of once per
    surface):
    1. A shared token-mint failure is now logged ONCE
       (`"github run-context resolution failed"`) and skips BOTH surfaces,
       instead of the check surface logging its own mint failure while the
       comment surface separately re-mints and proceeds.
    2. The token is now minted BEFORE either surface's claim decision (claim
       TTL is 120s, comfortably covering it), so a caller that loses a claim
       race, or finds a fresh live claim held by someone else, still mints a
       token it ends up not using. Previously mint happened strictly after a
       successful claim. Within each surface the claim-before-POST ordering
       itself (claim → GitHub POST/PATCH → persist/release) is unchanged.
       `github-checks-claim.test.ts` / `github-pr-comment-claim.test.ts` had
       two `mintInstallationToken` call-count assertions each that assumed the
       old mint-after-claim timing; updated in place with comments explaining
       the new expected counts — no other assertion in either file changed.
  - `resolveCommentBaseRun` (github-pr-comment.ts) was a near-verbatim copy of
    `resolveBaseRun` (`run-diff.ts`), differing only in which statuses count as
    a baseline. `resolveBaseRun` now takes an `opts.statuses` param (default
    `["passed"]`); the PR-comment path passes the new
    `TERMINAL_RUN_STATUSES` const (`schemas.ts`, derived into
    `CompleteRunPayloadSchema`'s `z.enum` so the two can't drift) so failures
    already present on the previous push's run classify as known. The local
    copy is deleted.
  - `buildCheckRunOutput`'s title ternary and 3-line stats table are now
    `runHeadline` / `runSummaryTable`, exported from `github-checks.ts` next to
    `formatDuration` and reused by `buildPrCommentBody` — the
    "check-run headline parity" test now holds by construction instead of by
    copy-paste.
  - `github-pr-comment-claim.test.ts`'s hand-rolled `pgType`/`createTableSql`
    are gone in favor of `resetTables`/`createTableSql` from
    `pg-integration/harness.ts` (matching every other pglite integration test);
    the unique `(projectId, repo, prNumber)` index — not expressible by the
    harness's column-only DDL — is still created separately, as before.
    `github-checks-claim.test.ts` / `sharded-complete.test.ts` were left on
    their existing local-DDL pattern (out of scope for this pass).
  - Minor: `bucketListedResults` no longer builds its `byTestId` lookup Map on
    the no-diff early-return path (it was unused there); the stale-run guard
    in `github-pr-comment.ts` gained a one-line comment on the ULID-ordering
    invariant it relies on.

### Files (follow-up)

- `apps/dashboard/src/lib/github-run-context.ts` — new; `GithubRunContext` +
  `resolveGithubRunContext`.
- `apps/dashboard/src/lib/github-run-surfaces.ts` — new; `postGithubRunSurfaces`.
- `apps/dashboard/src/lib/github-checks.ts`,
  `apps/dashboard/src/lib/github-pr-comment.ts` — split into `post*Surface`
  (context-taking) + thin `maybePost*` wrappers; shared `runHeadline` /
  `runSummaryTable`.
- `apps/dashboard/src/lib/run-diff.ts` — `resolveBaseRun(scope, headRun, opts?)`.
- `apps/dashboard/src/lib/schemas.ts` — `TERMINAL_RUN_STATUSES`.
- `apps/dashboard/src/lib/ingest.ts` — three call sites now call
  `postGithubRunSurfaces`.
- `apps/dashboard/src/__tests__/github-checks-claim.test.ts`,
  `apps/dashboard/src/__tests__/github-pr-comment-claim.test.ts` — two
  mint-call-count assertions each updated for the new mint-before-claim timing;
  the latter also now uses the shared pglite harness.
- `apps/dashboard/src/__tests__/run-diff.workers.test.ts` — the
  `resolveBaseRun` scoping test asserts `inArray(status, [...])` instead of
  `eq(status, "passed")`.
- `apps/dashboard/src/__tests__/ingest-pipeline.workers.test.ts` — a comment
  updated to name `postGithubRunSurfaces`.

### Verification (follow-up)

- `pnpm --filter @wrightful/dashboard test` — both lanes green: 615 + 4 skipped
  (Node) and 1352 (workers) — no regressions.
- `pnpm --filter @wrightful/reporter test` — 300 passed, unaffected.
- `pnpm check` — 0 errors (141 pre-existing warnings in untouched files, none
  new).

## Follow-up 2: shared claim lifecycle + wrapper deletion (review pass)

A structural review of the first follow-up found it had stopped one move short:
the claim-before-POST state machine was still cloned across both surfaces, and
the `maybePostGithubCheck` / `maybePostGithubPrComment` wrappers had zero
production callers (kept only for the claim tests). Addressed:

- **`src/lib/github-surface-post.ts` (new).** `postWithClaimedSlot(surface,
runId, initialId, io, post)` owns the correctness-critical ordering both
  surfaces previously duplicated — claim the POST slot, re-read the external
  id after a lost race, release the claim on a failed POST (CAS on the token),
  persist the posted id — with each surface supplying four single-query
  `ClaimedSlotIO` operations against its own table. Also hosts
  `githubWriteId` (POST/PATCH → throw on non-2xx → parse `{id}`), the fetch
  envelope both surfaces previously duplicated; it lives here rather than in
  `github-http.ts` so it calls the _imported_ `githubFetch` binding the claim
  tests mock. The PR comment's PATCH-404-repost branch stays local to
  `postComment` (it needs the 404/ok distinction).
- **`src/lib/github-run-render.ts` (new).** `statusToConclusion`,
  `formatDuration`, `runHeadline`, `runSummaryTable` moved out of
  `github-checks.ts` — the PR-comment surface no longer imports pure render
  helpers from its peer surface module.
- **Wrappers deleted.** `maybePostGithubCheck` / `maybePostGithubPrComment`
  are gone; `postGithubRunSurfaces` is the single production entry point, and
  the surface modules now import `GithubRunContext` type-only (the runtime
  leaf-module constraint, and its DAG doc essay, went away with the wrappers).
  This also removes an inconsistency where the same resolution failure logged
  different messages depending on entry point.
- **`resolveGithubRunContext`** returns null early when the run has neither a
  `commitSha` nor a `prNumber` (no surface could post — skips the
  installation lookup and token mint), and the hand-copied 20-field return
  literal collapsed into a destructure + spread of the row.
- **Accepted behavior change:** on the PR-comment path, content assembly
  (`buildContent`) now runs inside the shared post step, so a DB failure
  while building the comment body releases a held claim instead of leaking it
  until the 120s TTL. Claim/POST/persist ordering is otherwise unchanged.
- **Tests.** `github-checks-claim.test.ts` now drives the production entry
  point `postGithubRunSurfaces` (its fixtures have no `prNumber`, so the
  comment surface no-ops) and uses the shared `resetTables` harness instead
  of its local DDL. `github-pr-comment-claim.test.ts` composes
  `resolveGithubRunContext` + `postPrCommentSurface` directly (its fixtures
  carry a `commitSha`, so the orchestrator would also fire the check-run
  surface into the mocked fetch). No assertion values changed.

## Follow-up 3: PR-comment write mutex (PR #60 review pass, 2026-07-20)

Codex flagged (P1) that the sticky comment — ONE GitHub resource shared by
every run on a PR — was only claim-protected for the FIRST POST. Two distinct
runs finishing concurrently could (a) PATCH the comment concurrently, so the
older run's body could land last at GitHub even though the DB `runId` CAS kept
the newer id, and (b) on the very first comment, a newer run that lost the
POST claim returned without retrying, stranding the comment on the older run.

- **`postWithWriteMutex` (new, `src/lib/github-surface-post.ts`).** The
  sticky-comment surface now serializes EVERY write (first POST and later
  PATCHes) on the row's claim column: claim → re-read under the mutex →
  write → persist `{commentId, runId}` (CAS on the claim) → release. A caller
  that loses the claim waits and retries, bounded
  (`4 attempts × 1.5s` — so a crashed holder's unexpired claim costs ingest
  at most ~4.5s, not the 120s TTL). The persisted `runId` doubles as the
  monotonic guard: a caller observing `runId >= its own` skips, which also
  dedupes retried finalizes of the same run. `claimPrCommentSlot` dropped its
  `commentId IS NULL` predicate (claim = write mutex now, not first-POST
  slot); the persist-time `runId` OR-guard collapsed into the claim CAS.
- **Check-run surface unchanged** on `postWithClaimedSlot`: the check run is
  per-run, so concurrent posters render identical content and PATCH races are
  benign. Both flows now release a held claim when GitHub's 2xx response
  carries no id (CodeRabbit; previously that leaked the claim for the TTL).
- **`formatDuration`** rounds to the displayed tenth before the `< 60`
  comparison, so 59.96s renders `1m 0s` instead of `60.0s` (CodeRabbit).
- **Tests.** `github-pr-comment-claim.test.ts` adds both cross-run races
  (first-comment POST race and concurrent PATCHes; asserts the newest run's
  body is the LAST write to reach GitHub in every interleaving). New
  `github-surface-post.workers.test.ts` covers the fake-IO branches pglite
  can't reach deterministically (mutex give-up, no-id release, rethrow).
  Claim tests import schema via `@schema` per repo convention.
