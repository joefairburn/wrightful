# 2026-07-26 — Thermo-nuclear review remediation

## Why

A deep maintainability audit of the `run-loading-indicator` branch found four
blocking problems behind an otherwise good set of decompositions. Two were real
defects, two were places where the branch's own safety claims were not actually
enforced.

The headline: the ingest split looked like a large simplification (2,151 lines →
1,362 across five modules) but the code count barely moved — **1,263 → 1,262
code lines, 791 → 18 comment lines**. The reduction was almost entirely deleted
rationale, and three invariants lost the only thing protecting them.

## What changed

### Lock ordering (defect)

`team-lock.ts` states that the team key-share lock must precede "any project,
invite, group, or **membership** lock". Every team-child mutator honoured it
except `members-repo.ts` — and that is the one the branch had just given a
_second_ child-table write (`removeTeamGroupLinks`). It therefore held
`memberships` rows while acquiring `memberGroupMembers` rows, while team
teardown's cascade takes those in the opposite order (`memberGroups` →
`memberGroupMembers` before `memberships`, per constraint-creation order). That
is a genuine 40P01 cycle, new in the same PR that authored the lock module.
Pre-PR it was impossible: the function locked one table, so it could be waited
on but could never wait.

- `setMemberRole`, `removeMemberGuarded`, and `leaveTeamGuarded` now open with
  `lockTeamForChildMutation`. A lost lock maps to each function's existing
  "already gone" outcome, so observable behaviour is unchanged: the team is gone,
  therefore the membership cascaded with it, which is exactly what a zero-row
  write already reported.
- New Postgres regression in `team-lock-order.test.ts` proves the cycle is
  broken: with teardown holding the parent, the removal parks at `teams` and
  holds _neither_ child row, so a `for update nowait` on both still succeeds.
  Verified by mutation — removing the lock makes it fail.
- The invariant is now recorded in `AGENTS.md`, which never mentioned it.

Note: the 7-line deadlock-ordering proof in `member-groups.ts:replaceMembers` was
NOT removed. Key-share locks do not conflict with each other, so two sibling
child mutations can both hold the parent and still race on `memberships` rows —
that comment is still load-bearing.

### Ingest module boundaries

`ingest.ts` was five bare `export *`, which widened the pipeline's public API
from 42 to 51 symbols and made nine deliberately-private helpers reachable from
any route. It now re-exports an explicit **9-symbol** production surface; tests
import the submodule directly, so "this test pokes at internals" is visible at
the import site.

`primitives.ts` (542 lines, seven unrelated concerns) is dissolved:

- Postgres chunking → new `src/lib/db/chunk.ts`, beside `db/batch.ts`. This is
  what forced `retention.ts`, `groups-page.ts` and `results-page.ts` to import
  the entire ingest graph — realtime publish, owners-repo, usage — to get a chunk
  size. All three now import no ingest code at all.
- `STATUS_BUCKET_MEMBERS` / `statusBucket` → `src/lib/status-buckets.ts`, the
  module whose own doc-comment already designated it the single home for the
  taxonomy. `statusBucket` returns `StatusGroupKey | null` rather than
  `keyof AggregateDelta`, which is both more precise and keeps that module
  dependency-free as documented. The two reverse-index builds there were
  near-duplicates and now share one `reverseIndex` helper.
- `statusMatchSql` **deleted**. It interpolated statuses into `sql.raw` with
  hand-quoting; its only justification (D1 bound-param text affinity) died with
  D1 and its safety comment was lost in the move. All six call sites use
  `inArray(testResults.status, …)` — the idiom already in use one line away in
  `results-page.ts`.
- `maybeUpdateCodeowners` → `lifecycle.ts`, its only caller, now module-private.
- `statementChangedRows = changedRows` (a pure identity alias) and the dead
  `_existingIds` parameter deleted.
- The remainder is renamed `write-and-publish.ts` — statement builders plus the
  commit-then-publish tail — because that is a responsibility you can state in
  one sentence and "primitives" was not.

`countMonitors`' `type` parameter was dead (cap enforcement moved into
`createMonitor`'s transaction) and was also the branch that bypassed
`childProjectScopeWhere` for a raw `eq`. Removed.

### Guards that were not actually guarded

- `artifacts-pipeline.test.ts` stubbed `.for()` as a hardcoded non-empty row,
  which made **both** fail-closed guards in `finalizeUploads` permanently true —
  the `runNotFound` path the previous worklog headlines was unreachable, and
  deleting either `return null` kept the suite green. `.for()` is now a chaining
  lock modifier like `.where`, drawing from the same FIFO. Two negative tests
  cover team-gone and project-gone, each asserting the signer was never called.
  The team-gone case deliberately supplies a _live_ project afterwards, without
  which the project guard masks the team guard and the test proves nothing.
- The 409 terminal-idempotency contract had zero tests in the file this branch
  created to test that route. Added two, including that the conflict takes
  precedence over the soft-limit warning header.

All four new guard tests were mutation-verified: each fails when its guard is
removed.

### Documentation that contradicted the code

Three docs asserted the opposite of what ships, all in files `AGENTS.md`
designates authoritative:

- `db/schema.ts` claimed the `team.delete` audit row "is still captured …
  awaited SYNCHRONOUSLY before the delete batch". That write was removed. It now
  explains why team deletion is deliberately unaudited (a pre-delete row cascades
  away on success and _survives a failed teardown_, recording a deletion that
  never happened).
- `audit.ts` mandated calling `recordAudit` before the delete statement. No
  caller does; a contributor following it would reintroduce the bug this branch
  fixed. It now documents the `buildAuditRow`-inside-the-transaction pattern.
- `env.ts` credited the monitor caps to a "TYPE-SCOPED `countMonitors`" that no
  longer exists.
- `AUDIT_ACTIONS.TEAM_DELETE` had zero production writers; removed with its UI
  label.
- `AGENTS.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` still named `src/lib/ingest.ts` as the
  pipeline's home, so an agent following the guardrail would add pipeline code to
  what is now a re-export file.

Restored rationale at the three unguarded invariants: the catalog-upsert sort
(a global lock ordering preventing AB/BA deadlock, explicitly _not_
`localeCompare`), the deliberate non-metering of testResults usage (metering it
serialized every concurrent `/results` flush across a whole team on one row), and
`resultUpsertSet`'s insert-only `createdAt`. Also the `?edit=1` defence on the
monitor page and the shard-2 note in the e2e suite.

### pg-integration parallelism made structural

Running `src/__tests__/pg-integration/` against a real database is only safe
serially: the files share one database and each `resetTables` drops and recreates
its tables, so a concurrent run lets one file drop a table another is asserting
on. It fails different tests each time — a forced-parallel run here produced 4
failures then 17.

This was already known and documented (`harness.ts`, and `ci.yml` passes
`--no-file-parallelism`), but it was held up entirely by remembering a flag on
one command line. A plain `pnpm test` with `PG_TEST_URL` set was silently flaky,
which is how it was rediscovered.

`vite.config.ts` now derives it: `fileParallelism: !process.env.PG_TEST_URL` —
the same variable that selects the shared database also serializes the lane, so
every invocation is correct by default. The pglite lane (each file its own
in-process instance) still runs fully parallel and is unaffected. CI's flag stays
as redundant reinforcement. Verified both directions: unflagged runs now pass
110/110 repeatedly, and forcing `fileParallelism: true` reproduces the flakiness.

### pg-integration can no longer wipe a real database

`buildHarness()` accepted whatever `PG_TEST_URL` pointed at, and `resetTables`
runs `DROP TABLE … CASCADE` on every table a suite touches. Pointing it at a
database that mattered destroyed it — and nothing complained, because dropping
tables is the harness's normal behaviour.

The failure mode was the bad one. Demonstrated against a stand-in
`wrightful_prod` holding one row: the unguarded run reported **3 tests passed**
while taking that table from 1 row to 0. A green suite that silently wiped a
database.

`assertDisposableTestDatabase` now rejects any `PG_TEST_URL` whose database name
is not `test` or `*_test`, before a connection is opened. Host is deliberately
not checked: CI service containers use assorted hostnames, so a localhost rule
would reject legitimate setups while still permitting the dangerous case of a
production database that happens to run locally. There is no opt-out, because an
escape hatch for "drop every table here" is exactly what ends up exported in a
shell profile.

Only the destructive lane is guarded. The `workers-db` lane also reads
`DATABASE_URL` and `.env.local`, but it is read-only (`select 1`,
`select count(*) from (values …)`) and never touches real tables, so guarding it
would break the documented dev workflow for no safety gain.

Covered by `src/__tests__/pg-test-url-guard.test.ts` (15 cases, including the
exact URL CI uses), and verified end-to-end in both directions.

## Verification

Postgres 17 was installed and run locally, so the `pg-integration` suites
actually executed rather than skipping — the previous worklog notes they could
not run in that sandbox.

- `pnpm check`: **0 errors**, 148 warnings — the same warning count as
  `origin/main`.
- Dashboard workers: 1,409 passed. Dashboard node: 736 passed, 4 skipped
  (against real Postgres; serialization is now automatic). Reporter: 326 passed.
- Mutation-tested: the members-repo parent lock (5 unit failures + the Postgres
  regression), both `finalizeUploads` guards, and the 409 branch.

**Not run:** the Playwright dashboard suite and the full-stack E2E harness.

## 2026-07-29 — PR #72 bot-review triage

A second pass over the CodeRabbit / Codex comments on PR #72. Eleven findings;
seven were real and are fixed below, four were wrong and are recorded with the
evidence so the next reader does not re-litigate them.

### Fixed

**Unicode group keys 500 the groups paginator.** `encodeKeyset` called
`btoa(segments.join(":"))`, and `btoa` throws for any code point above U+00FF.
Group keys are raw file paths and project names, so a spec file named
`テスト.spec.ts` made "next page" a 500. The codec now base64s the UTF-8 bytes
in both directions, with `TextDecoder(…, {fatal: true})` so corrupt bytes reach
the existing malformed→null path instead of decoding to mojibake. ASCII encodes
identically, so cursors already in flight keep working — pinned by a test.

**A late shard could downgrade the watchdog's `interrupted`.** The sharded
`completeRun` done-branch wrote `status: finalStatus` computed from `runShards`
alone, while the non-sharded sibling merged through `mergeRunStatusSql`. The
stale-run watchdog writes `interrupted` to the _run_ row and never touches a
shard row, so a missing shard reporting `passed` inside the 30-minute
`runClosedForWrites` grace turned a run that lost a shard green. Now merged, as
the sibling path already was. Two tests: the downgrade must not happen, and a
late `failed` shard must still escalate past `interrupted` (worst-wins, not
stored-wins). Mutation-checked — reverting the fix fails the first.

**Direct-R2 cleanup could still orphan an in-flight upload.** A presigned PUT's
expiry is checked when R2 _receives_ the request, not when the body finishes, so
an upload starting a second before the 15-minute TTL may still be streaming long
after. The 60-second grace was beaten by any large artifact on a slow uplink,
and the final sweep then deleted the outbox row while the object was still
landing. The grace is now 30 minutes, which covers the default 50 MiB
`WRIGHTFUL_MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES` cap at ~230 Kbit/s. The derived window is
exported as `CLEANUP_FINALIZE_AFTER_SECONDS` so the tests advance the clock past
the real value instead of a hand-copied literal that would quietly stop
exercising the final verification pass.

**Cleanup retries could crowd out newer deletions.** The sweep takes the four
oldest due jobs every five minutes, and the first error retry was 60 seconds —
so a failing cohort stayed eligible on consecutive ticks. Two changes: the first
retry is now 6 minutes (longer than the cron interval, so a retry always skips a
tick), and the sweep orders by `nextAttemptAt` rather than `createdAt`, i.e.
longest-overdue first. A job that just ran now yields to one that has been
waiting. That is also the `projectArtifactCleanupJobs_due_idx` column order, so
the sort reads off the index instead of sorting. Mutation-checked against the
old ordering.

**`PG_TEST_URL` was echoed into two error messages.** A rejected connection
string routinely carries a password and these errors land in CI logs. The
database name — the part that makes the failure actionable — is still reported;
the URL is not. A test now asserts neither the URL nor the password appears in
either rejection path.

**The primary invite-accept path swallowed unexpected failures.** Only the
unique-violation branch was handled; a genuine transaction failure redirected
with a generic flash and left nothing in Cloudflare Tail. Now routed through
`logMutationFailure`, as the sibling settings actions already are.

**`chunkBySize` returned zero chunks for a `NaN` size.** `Math.max(1, NaN)` is
`NaN`, so the loop's first comparison was false and every row the caller meant
to write was dropped silently. Normalized to a finite integer ≥ 1. Defensive
rather than a live bug, but the failure mode was silent data loss.

### Rejected, with evidence

**"CircleCI reruns reuse the idempotency key" (Codex, P1).** The premise is
false: rerunning a CircleCI workflow allocates a _new_ `CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID` —
that is exactly why `CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_WORKSPACE_ID` exists as the stable
identifier across reruns. `ciBuildId` reads `CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID`, so a rerun
already keys distinctly and never hits the new 409.

**"Playwright already gives reporters the selected projects" (CodeRabbit).**
Empirically false. Running a three-project config with `--project=beta` and a
reporter that prints `config.projects` yields `["alpha","beta","gamma"]` — the
list is _unfiltered_. The `cliProjectFilters` parsing this asked us to delete is
load-bearing for the idempotency key. Its variadic consumption of trailing
positionals also mirrors Playwright's own commander parsing, so it is consistent
rather than brittle.

**"`vp pack` does not accept `--tsconfig`" (CodeRabbit).** `vp pack --help`
lists `--tsconfig <tsconfig>`, and `packages/reporter/tsconfig.build.json`
exists. The web search this was based on was wrong on both counts.

**"Seed `teams`/`projects` before inserting `runs`" (CodeRabbit).** The suite
passes 18/18 as written: the pg-integration harness creates only the tables a
file touches, so the FK to `teams` is never created for this file.

### Verification (PR #72 triage)

- `pnpm check`: **0 errors**, 148 warnings — unchanged from `9e9c816`.
- Dashboard node 750 passed / 8 skipped, dashboard workers 1,412 passed,
  reporter 326 passed.
- Playwright project-filtering claim tested against real Playwright 1.61.1.
- Mutation-checked: the sharded status merge and the sweep ordering both fail
  their new tests when reverted.

**Not run:** the Playwright dashboard suite and the full-stack E2E harness.

## 2026-07-29 — PR #72 second triage: lost parent locks

Five more comments on the same PR. Four were real; the fifth is answered rather
than changed.

### Fixed

**Three lost-parent-lock branches did not follow the guardrail.** AGENTS.md
requires a failed `lockTeamForChildMutation` to map to the caller's existing
"already gone" outcome, because a lost lock means teardown committed and no
retry can ever succeed. Three callers still treated it as an operational error:

- `createMonitor` threw `Error("team not found")`, which the create action fed
  to `mutationErrorMessage` as "Could not create monitor — please try again."
  It now returns `null` — the same gone signal the other scoped repo functions
  use — and the action 404s, matching what `updateMonitor` already does for a
  monitor that vanished.
- `createGroup` threw the same string and surfaced "Could not save the group.
  Please try again." It now returns `null`, mirroring the `false` its sibling
  `updateGroup` already returns; the action falls through to its redirect and
  the loader reports the missing team.
- `acceptDirectedInvite`'s already-a-member cleanup discarded the lock result
  and then returned `{ok: true}` carrying the deleted team's slug, sending the
  user to a team that no longer exists. It now returns the existing 404.

Each has a pg-integration test: a missing `teams` row is precisely what the
key-share lock observes post-teardown, and the invite case drops the team
between the two transactions with a `db.transaction` spy.

### Answered, not changed

**"Preserve or version legacy non-ASCII keyset cursors" (CodeRabbit, major).**
The premise is right: a cursor minted before the UTF-8 change over a Latin-1
key (`btoa("4:value:café")` wrote a bare `0xE9`) no longer decodes. The
prescription is not. A Latin-1 fallback would still mis-read a legacy key whose
bytes happen to be valid UTF-8 (`"Ã©"` → `"é"`), so it trades a first-page reset
for a silently wrong page boundary; only a version tag is complete, and that is
permanent surface area for a window that closes the next time anyone clicks
"next page". These cursors are query params on an open paginator, and the
malformed→null fallback the codec already documents is a first-page reset, not
data loss. Policy recorded in the codec's doc comment and pinned by a test that
asserts the legacy `café` cursor expires.

**Duplicate `## Verification` heading (CodeRabbit, MD024).** Real; the earlier
PR-72 section's heading is now `### Verification (PR #72 triage)`, nested under
the dated section it belongs to.

### Verification

- `pnpm check`: **0 errors**, 154 warnings — byte-identical to the stashed
  tree, so this pass adds none.
- Dashboard node 766 passed / 8 skipped, dashboard workers 1,413 passed. The
  pg-integration additions ran under pglite (`PG_TEST_URL` unset here).
- Mutation-checked: all three lock branches fail their new tests when reverted
  to the throwing / discarding form.

**Not run:** the Playwright dashboard suite and the full-stack E2E harness.

## 2026-07-30 — PR #72 third triage: the artifact write transaction

An independent re-audit of the branch's own lock guardrail. Three fixes plus
the missing release metadata.

### The guardrail did not hold for `artifacts`

`AGENTS.md` names `artifacts` in the parent-first list, but only the PRESIGN
transaction in `registerArtifacts` took `lockTeamForChildMutation`. The write
transaction — inserts/updates on `artifacts`, then the `usageCounters` upsert —
took no parent lock at all.

That is a real 40P01, and the reason it is easy to miss is that neither lock in
the cycle is written down. Both are IMPLICIT FK locks:

- `INSERT artifacts` fires `artifacts_projectId_projects_id_fk` → `FOR KEY
SHARE` on the **project** row.
- `INSERT usageCounters` fires `usageCounters_teamId_teams_id_fk` → `FOR KEY
SHARE` on the **team** row.

So the transaction acquired project-then-team, the exact inverse of teardown,
which holds `teams FOR UPDATE` and cascades down through `projects`. Comparing
the two CHILD tables' cascade order — the obvious way to check — says there is
no cycle, and is the wrong frame; the parents are what deadlock.

The window is narrow: `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` does not re-fire the team FK, so
it opens on a team's first metered artifact write of a UTC month. Narrow enough
to survive testing indefinitely, which is the point.

Fixed by opening the write transaction with `lockTeamForChildMutation`, mapping
a lost lock to the `runNotFound` the presign path already returns.

Two regressions, because the two failure modes are distinct:

- `artifacts-pipeline.test.ts` covers the GUARD (lost lock → no write, no
  signing). Its FIFO deliberately lets everything downstream succeed, so
  `signPut` never being called is what isolates it — an earlier draft passed
  under mutation because the project guard masked it.
- `artifact-presign-teardown.test.ts` covers the ORDERING against real
  Postgres. `resetTables` omits FKs and indexes, so this case recreates the two
  FK constraints that form the cycle — without them the pre-fix code passes and
  the test proves nothing. Mutation-checked: deleting the lock line makes the
  writer hold the project row while parked on `teams`, and the blocker's
  `for update nowait` on `projects` raises 55P03.

### `readArtifact` trusted a second evaluator over R2

`read.ts` asks R2 to apply preconditions via `onlyIf`, then re-derives the
reason in JS so a bodyless reply can be reported as 304 vs 412. When those
disagreed — no body, but the re-derivation says "body" — the outcome was
`"body"`, which serves `Response(null, 200)` still carrying the object's
`content-length`. A malformed 200 where the pre-split code unconditionally
returned 304.

Now a disagreement falls back to `not-modified`. No trigger was constructible
(both implementations key on `uploaded` and follow RFC 9110 order), so this is
a latent hazard, not a live bug — but the safe default is the total one.

`readArtifact` had no unit coverage at all; the new
`artifact-read-adapter.workers.test.ts` mocks `void/storage` and pins six
cases, including that the fallback does NOT bleed into the HEAD path (a plain
HEAD is a 200).

### `leaveTeamGuarded` reported a lost lock as "last owner"

A lost parent lock mapped to `{reason: "lastOwner"}`, on the argument that the
zero-row delete would have returned the same value. True of the return value,
but the caller renders it as **"You're the last owner — delete the team
instead"** — false, and an instruction to do something impossible for a team
that no longer exists. `LeaveTeamResult` now has a `gone` arm and the action
redirects to `/` without the audit write (the team's `auditLog` cascaded too).

### Release metadata

The reporter's user-visible changes shipped with no changeset, so merging would
have left npm on `0.2.1`. Added one at **minor** (`0.3.0`): pre-1.0 that is the
breaking tier, and `^0.2.1` cannot cross it, so no consumer is silently
auto-upgraded into the new idempotency contract.

**Still open — needs a product decision, not a patch.** A `0.2.x` reporter
derives its key from `GITHUB_RUN_ID`, which is stable across reruns, so once
the dashboard ships the 409 every rerun on an old reporter is refused and
reports nothing (the reporter warns and disables streaming; the CI job stays
green). Nothing gates the 409 on `reporterVersion` — it is stored but never
read. Either gate it, or accept it and communicate the upgrade ordering.

### Verification

- `pnpm check`: **0 errors**, 154 warnings — unchanged.
- Against real Postgres 17 (`PG_TEST_URL` set, so pg-integration ran rather
  than skipped): dashboard node 773 passed / 4 skipped, dashboard workers 1,419
  passed, reporter 326 passed.
- Mutation-checked: the write-tx guard (unit), the write-tx lock ordering
  (Postgres, 55P03), and the `readArtifact` 304 fallback each fail their test
  when reverted.

**Not run:** the Playwright dashboard suite and the full-stack E2E harness.
