# Wrightful

A Playwright test reporting dashboard. Ships as two pieces:

- **`@wrightful/reporter`** — Playwright reporter that streams results and artifacts to the dashboard live as each test completes.
- **`@wrightful/dashboard`** — a Cloudflare Worker (Vite + React 19 RSC on RedwoodSDK, Kysely over Durable Objects: a singleton `ControlDO` for auth/tenancy and one `TenantDO` per team for test data; R2 for artifacts) that ingests results and serves the UI.

## Deploy your own dashboard

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/joefairburn/wrightful/tree/main/packages/dashboard)

One click provisions an R2 bucket and the Durable Object classes (`ControlDO`, `TenantDO`, `SyncedStateServer`) from `packages/dashboard/wrangler.jsonc`, then runs `deploy`. Each DO migrates itself lazily on first access — no separate migrate step. Artifact uploads and downloads use the native R2 binding, so no S3 credentials are needed. A few manual steps remain:

1. **Sign up** in the deployed dashboard and **create a team + project** via `/settings/teams/new` and `/settings/teams/<team-slug>/projects/new`.
2. **Mint an API key** from the project's keys page (`/settings/teams/<team-slug>/p/<project-slug>/keys`). The plaintext key is shown once on creation; the server only stores its SHA-256 hash.

## Wire up the reporter

In your Playwright project:

```bash
pnpm add -D @wrightful/reporter
```

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [["list"], ["@wrightful/reporter"]],
});
```

Set credentials in CI (`WRIGHTFUL_TOKEN` is a project-scoped API key — generate one from your project's settings page in the dashboard):

```yaml
env:
  WRIGHTFUL_URL: https://your-dashboard-url.com
  WRIGHTFUL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.WRIGHTFUL_TOKEN }}
```

Results appear in the dashboard live as tests complete. Shards converge on a single run via a deterministic idempotency key derived from `GITHUB_RUN_ID` (or the equivalent on GitLab/CircleCI). See [`examples/github-actions-workflow.yml`](./examples/github-actions-workflow.yml) for a full workflow.

## Local development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm setup:local                                # .dev.vars + demo team/project/API key (over HTTP)
pnpm dev                                        # dashboard on localhost

# Need additional API keys for local testing? Mint them from the dashboard
# at http://localhost:5173/settings/teams/<team-slug>/p/<project-slug>/keys.

# Populate months of synthetic run history instead of the small Playwright
# fixture set (exercises the history chart, flaky tests page, run-list
# pagination). Implies --no-fixtures.
pnpm setup:local --history                              # 3 months, seed=wrightful-seed-1
pnpm setup:local --history --history-months 6           # 6 months
```
