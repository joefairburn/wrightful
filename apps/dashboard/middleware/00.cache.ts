/**
 * Default-deny Cache-Control stamp — the safety net for Cloudflare Workers
 * Cache (`cache: { enabled: true }` in wrangler.template.jsonc).
 *
 * Workers Cache follows RFC 9111 *including heuristic freshness*: a response
 * with NO Cache-Control header and a heuristically-cacheable status (200, 404,
 * …) may be stored in the shared edge cache and served to other visitors. A
 * session cookie on the request does NOT bypass the cache (only a response
 * `Set-Cookie` / request `Authorization` header does) and the cache key does
 * not include cookies — so an unstamped, cookie-authed tenant page would be a
 * cross-tenant leak once the shared cache is on. Stamping `private, no-store`
 * on every response that didn't set an explicit policy makes edge caching
 * opt-in: /assets/* chunks (Void's asset entry + void.json routing.headers)
 * and artifact downloads (`src/lib/artifacts.ts`) declare `public, …`
 * themselves.
 *
 * Must sort BEFORE `00.errors.ts` (outermost) so the stamp lands on the FINAL
 * response — including the /oops and /not-found rewrites (404 is a
 * heuristically-cacheable status).
 *
 * The stamp covers both ways a response leaves the stack:
 *   - the normal post-`next()` `c.res`, and
 *   - a Response *thrown* past `next()`. On `/api/*` paths `00.errors` never
 *     rewrites; it re-throws control-flow Responses (e.g. a handler's `throw
 *     new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 })`) and genuine Errors alike.
 *     A thrown Response becomes the wire response via Hono's throw-Response
 *     handling, so without the catch below a GET 404 with no Cache-Control
 *     could be heuristically edge-cached. Genuine Errors (and anything that
 *     already set a policy) propagate / pass through unchanged.
