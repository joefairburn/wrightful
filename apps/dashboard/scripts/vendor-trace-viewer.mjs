// Vendor the official Playwright Trace Viewer bundle into `public/trace-viewer/`
// so we serve its service worker + snapshot shell (and the standalone SPA) from
// our OWN origin. Our native React trace viewer (`src/trace-viewer/`) drives
// that SW through a hidden bridge iframe (`bridge.html`), so a test's trace
// bytes replay in-dashboard and never bounce out to the public
// trace.playwright.dev. The bundle ships inside `playwright-core` as a
// position-independent Vite build (relative asset refs, a scope-relative service
// worker), so a plain recursive copy into a subdir Just Works (see the worklog
// + plan for why no rewrites/scope headers are needed).
//
// Runs in the dev/build/deploy pre-hooks. The output dir is gitignored: it's a
// generated artifact, pinned to the installed playwright-core version and
// regenerated whenever that version changes. Fails LOUDLY if the source layout
// moves on a Playwright upgrade so a silent breakage can't ship.
