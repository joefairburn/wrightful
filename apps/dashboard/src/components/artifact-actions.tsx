/**
 * Shared artifact-presentation type contract. These interfaces are the wire
 * shape the server-side seam (`@/lib/test-artifact-actions`) produces and the
 * test-detail rail (`artifacts-rail.tsx` / `visual-diff-dialog.tsx`) renders.
 *
 * The horizontal run-detail action-row component that used to live here
 * (`ArtifactActions` + its per-type buttons) was never mounted — the run-detail
 * row has no artifact-rendering host — so it was removed along with the loader
 * that fed it. Only the type contract remains.
