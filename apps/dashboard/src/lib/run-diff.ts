 * everything here reads existing columns.
 *
 * Three pieces:
 *   - `loadRunTestStatuses` — the projectId+runId-scoped read of one run's
 *     per-test outcomes (one row per testId).
 *   - `resolveBaseRun` — pick the natural baseline: the most recent PASSED run
 *     on the same branch, created before the head run.
 *   - `diffRuns` — 100% PURE classification of two status arrays into buckets.
 *
 * Logical tenancy: there is no DO boundary, so every query carries
 * `scope.projectId` (and the `runs` reads carry `(teamId, projectId)` via the
 * blessed `runByIdWhere` / `runScopeWhere`). A leaked runId can never read

// ─── Status taxonomy ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Per-test row statuses written by ingest are: `passed`, `failed`, `timedout`,
// `flaky`, `skipped`, `interrupted`, and `queued` (an in-flight placeholder for
// a planned-but-not-yet-run test). The diff classifies each testId from the
// vantage of "did this test get worse / better between base and head", which
// needs a coarse pass/fail/other verdict per row:
//
//   - FAILING  = `failed` | `timedout` | `interrupted`. These are the
//     non-passing terminal outcomes that should redden a run. (`interrupted` is
//     grouped with `flaky` for the UI counters, but for a run-to-run diff it is
//     a genuine non-pass — a test that didn't complete cleanly — so we count it
//     as failing here. Documented divergence from `@/lib/status`'s `groupKey`.)
//   - PASSING  = `passed`.
//   - FLAKY    = `flaky` status OR `retryCount > 0` (a test that ultimately
//     passed but only after a retry). A `flaky` row is treated as passing for
//     the failed/passed verdict (it ended green), but is surfaced separately in
//     `flakyDeltas` when its flaky-ness or retry count changed.
//   - OTHER    = `skipped` / `queued` / unknown — neither passing nor failing.
//     Treated as "absent of a real verdict": a test that goes passed→skipped is
//     NOT a newlyFailed, and skipped→passed is NOT a newlyPassed.
//
// Bucketing rules (a testId lands in at most ONE of the first three buckets,
// and may ALSO appear in flakyDeltas):
//   - newlyFailed   : passing/other/absent in base  → failing in head
//   - newlyPassed   : failing in base               → passing in head
//   - stillFailing  : failing in base               → failing in head
//   - flakyDeltas   : BOTH runs passed (verdict "passing") and the flaky-state
//                     OR retryCount changed. Restricted to passing↔passing so a
//                     failing/skipped row's retry count is never mislabeled as
//                     flaky (a skipped test never ran; a failing one is a status
//                     change, not flakiness).
//   - addedTests    : present in head, absent in base
//   - removedTests  : present in base, absent in head
