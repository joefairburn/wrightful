/**
 * Granular RBAC capability model (roadmap 3.1).
 *
 * `MembershipRole` is the stored, coarse identity (`owner | member | viewer`);
 * `Capability` is the fine-grained THING a role may do. `can(role, action)` is
 * the single source of truth that maps the former onto the latter, so every
 * gate in the app (the settings seams, the API handlers, the UI flags) asks the
 * same question instead of re-deriving `role === "owner"` inline. Keep it pure
 * (no I/O, no `Context`) so the whole matrix is exhaustively unit-testable.
 *
 * The capabilities, deliberately framed as VERBS over team resources:
 *  - `viewSettings`  — read the team/project settings pages (the privileged
 *                      surface: members + invites, keys list, retention, etc.).
 *  - `manageMembers` — change a member's role, remove a member, mint/revoke
 *                      invites (and pick the invited role).
 *  - `mintKeys`      — create/revoke project API keys, and the strictly-greater
 *                      monitor capability that transitively mints per-run keys.
 *  - `writeConfig`   — mutate team/project config (rename, slug, retention,
 *                      create projects, quarantine, test-ownership edits).
 *  - `deleteTeam`    — the irreversible team delete.

/**
 * The capability matrix. Defined explicitly (a full row per role) rather than
 * derived from a hierarchy so the grant set for every role reads off the page
 * and a future role can't silently inherit a capability.
 *
 * WHY member === viewSettings only (and NOT writeConfig / mintKeys):
 *   The pre-3.1 codebase has exactly two roles. Every *mutation* — key minting
 *   (`requireOwnedProjectScope`), config writes (`requireOwnerScope`), project
 *   creation, monitors, quarantine, member management, team delete — is already
 *   OWNER-gated; a plain `member` could only *read* the settings pages
 *   (`requireMemberScope`). So preserving TODAY's member capabilities (the hard
 *   constraint — don't downgrade existing members, and don't silently UPGRADE
 *   them either) means `member` maps to `viewSettings` and nothing more. If
 *   members were ever to gain write/mint rights it would be an intentional,
 *   reviewable change to this one table — not a side effect of adding viewer.
 *
 * WHY viewer === no capabilities:
 *   A viewer is a member for READ paths (run/test data, realtime) — the
 *   distinction is purely the absence of these privileged settings caps. It is
 *   NOT granted `viewSettings`: settings (members, keys, invites, retention) is
 *   a privileged surface, so a viewer reads the dashboard but 404s on the
 *   settings pages, exactly as the plan's manual check describes.
