 * used against the DO-SQLite driver. (The day/week divisors here intentionally
 * stay raw SQL text, not the {@link DAY_SEC}/{@link WEEK_SEC} JS constants
 * interpolated in, for exactly this reason — interpolating them would re-bind
 * them as params. The `bucketing.test.ts` parity test pins the two sides
 * together.)

 * text, not a bound param; pass `sql\`tr."createdAt"\`` and friends, never a

 *   - `<rn>` = `row_number() over (partition by … order by <value>)` (ASC), and

 * The picker can't see the CTE, so this contract is the caller's to uphold.

 * bound-parameter pipeline applies text affinity to numeric params, which would
 * corrupt the arithmetic. The quantile is rendered to two decimals to keep the
 * emitted literal stable (e.g. `0.50`, `0.95`).
 *
 * @param quantile  fraction in (0, 1], e.g. `0.95` for p95.
