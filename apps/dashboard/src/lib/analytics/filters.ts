 * dropped or misspelled `tr."projectId"` predicate is a cross-tenant data leak
 * that the raw `db.run(sql\`\`)` path hides from Drizzle's type checker.
 *
 * Concentrating it here makes the tenant boundary impossible to omit by accident
 * AND enforces the F13/scope.ts invariant — the parameter is a branded
 * {@link TenantScope}, so a raw `string` projectId can no longer reach a loader;
 * the auth-checked `scope.projectId` is the only thing that types. The id is
 * emitted as a BOUND parameter (`sql\`${scope.projectId}\``), never interpolated.
 *
 * Emits the join clause AND the leading `where tr."projectId" = ?` so callers
 * continue the WHERE with `and …` fragments (time window, branch, search,
 * testId-IN). The `runs` join is unconditional here — every caller that uses
 * this needs `runs` for its branch filter or a `runs.createdAt` window.
 * Raw-SQL passes that don't need the tenant WHERE built in (flaky's sparkline,
 * suite-size's tests-added) pair {@link ciRunsJoinFragment} with their own
 * predicate instead — the join text (and its synthetic exclusion) must stay
 * identical between the two.
