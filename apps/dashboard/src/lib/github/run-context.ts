/**
 * Resolve the shared {@link GithubRunContext} for `runId`, or `null` when
 * there is nothing to post: the run has no `repo`, has neither a commit sha
 * nor a PR number (no surface could attach to it), or no installation OWNED
 * BY THE RUN'S TEAM matches the repo owner. Cheap in the null case — no
 * token is minted.
 *
 * The installation lookup is scoped to `run.teamId` (not the repo-owner
 * string alone) on purpose — this is the confused-deputy security boundary
 * for BOTH surfaces: `run.repo` is attacker-controlled ingest input, so a
 * by-owner-only lookup would let any tenant name another org's repo and make
 * us mint THAT org's installation token to post a (merge-gating) check run or
 * PR comment on their repositories. Requiring the installation to belong to
 * the run's own team means a team can only post GitHub surfaces for an org IT
 * has connected. (`accountLogin` is globally unique, so the team predicate
 * narrows an otherwise-unique point seek down to "our installation or none" —
 * it's the authorization boundary, not a performance concern.)
 *
 * `projectId` is ANDed into every `runs` predicate below, per the
 * `runByIdWhere` convention (`@/lib/scope.ts`) — a caller passing a foreign
 * project's id finds nothing rather than falling through to another team's
 * run.
 *
 * The token is minted here, before either surface's claim decision, so one
 * mint covers both surfaces; the 120s claim TTLs comfortably cover it.
 * THROWS on a genuine failure (a DB error, or `mintInstallationToken`
 * failing) — the caller owns the error envelope.
