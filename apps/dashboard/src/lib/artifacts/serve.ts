/**
 * The ONE interface that serves a verified artifact's bytes. It owns the
 * proxy-vs-302 fork (ADR 0003), so the origin-safety policy is applied in
 * exactly one place regardless of which byte path a deployment takes:
 *
 *   - **Worker proxy** (default): `readArtifact` → `buildArtifactResponse`,
 *     which sanitises the token-carried content-type (`safeContentType`),
 *     forces `Content-Disposition: attachment`, and caps the SHARED-cache
 *     (`s-maxage`) window to the token's remaining life.
 *   - **Direct-R2 302** (`directConfig` present, GET only): mints a presigned
 *     R2 GET whose `response-content-type` / `response-content-disposition`
 *     overrides carry the SAME sanitised type + forced attachment, and whose
 *     expiry is capped to the SAME remaining token life.
 *
 * Before this seam existed the 302 branch re-asserted those three invariants
 * inline in the download route — a second home for the policy that could
 * silently diverge. The route is now auth + translation only; both branches,
 * and therefore both flag states, are cross-checked by the single policy test
 * (`src/__tests__/artifact-origin-safety.workers.test.ts`).
