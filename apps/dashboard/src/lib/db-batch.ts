/**
 * Atomicity-preserving wrapper over Postgres's transaction primitive. The
 * all-or-nothing guarantee is a durable decision: ingest documents it as its
 * atomicity boundary, and the settings/invite/teardown mutations rely on it to
 * avoid half-applied deletes/creates.
 *
 * A Drizzle statement is bound to the executor it was built from. A statement
 * built off the pooled `db` runs on a DIFFERENT connection than the one holding
 * the `BEGIN`, so it would NOT enroll in the transaction (and against a `max: 1`
 * pool it deadlocks). Atomicity therefore REQUIRES the statements to be built
 * against the transaction `tx`.
 *
 * Hence the contract: callers pass a **builder** `(tx) => statements[]` (never a
 * pre-built array). `runBatch` invokes it with the transaction executor so every
 * statement enrolls in the transaction — a call site cannot accidentally bind to
 * the pooled `db` and silently lose atomicity. The statement-builder helpers take
 * a required `exec` and always run inside this transaction (they receive `tx`),
 * so `BatchExecutor` is exactly the transaction executor type.
