 * never blocks the redirect; a failure never resurrects the project — it is
 * logged and dropped (the orphaned objects are unreferenced and unguessable).
 *
 * The genuinely-shared half of "destroy a project": the project-delete action
 * and the team-delete action's per-project loop both reclaim R2 bytes this
 * exact way. Call it ONLY after the project's rows are committed-gone — never
 * speculatively, so a failed row delete can't strand bytes (and so a team-delete
 * can keep its row deletion atomic and sweep only on the success path).

/**
 * Destroy ONE project: delete its row, then reclaim its R2 artifact bytes. The
 * single-project teardown the project-delete action (`keys.server.ts`) uses.
 *
 * Deletes only the `projects` row: every project-scoped child (apiKeys, runs,
 * testResults, testResultAttempts, testTags, testAnnotations, artifacts,
 * monitors, …) has an `onDelete: "cascade"` FK to `projects.id`, so the single
 * delete reclaims all dependent rows (which is why the old explicit
 * `db.delete(apiKeys)` was redundant). (`auditLog.projectId` is `set null`, so
 * an audit row survives the cascade with a null projectId — see `db/schema.ts`.)
 *
 * The row delete is AWAITED and may throw — the caller decides how to surface a
 * DB failure (the settings action redirects back with an inline error). The R2
 * sweep is scheduled only AFTER the delete resolves, via
 * {@link scheduleProjectArtifactCleanup}.
 *
 * The team-delete action does NOT use this — it deletes all of a team's project
 * rows in one atomic `runBatch` (so the whole-team teardown stays all-or-nothing)
 * and calls {@link scheduleProjectArtifactCleanup} per project on the success
 * path. Forcing that path through this per-project helper would have traded the
 * atomic batch for a partially-committable loop.
