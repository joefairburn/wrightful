 * Distinct, sorted branch list of runs in a project. Used by the run-history
 * branch filter in tests / flaky-tests / slowest-tests / run-detail.
 *
 * Single SELECT DISTINCT against the `runs` table, gated on the scoped
 * `projectId` (and teamId for defense in depth). The `(projectId, branch)`
 * leading prefix of the composite index `runs_project_branch_created_at_idx`
 * (on `(projectId, branch, createdAt)`) covers the equality filter plus the
 * DISTINCT + ORDER BY branch ASC scan. If this distinct-branch query proves
 * hot enough to warrant a narrower dedicated `(projectId, branch)` index, add
 * one in a new numbered migration — measure first; do not assume.
