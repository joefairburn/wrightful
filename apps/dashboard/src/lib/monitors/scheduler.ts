 * monitor's `nextRunAt`, what job bodies to enqueue — is `planMonitorSweep`, a
 * pure function with NO `void/db` import that is fully unit-testable with an
 * injected `makeId`. The IO — the SELECT with its `.limit` budget, the batch
 * write, and the enqueue loop — is `sweepDueMonitors`, integration-covered.
