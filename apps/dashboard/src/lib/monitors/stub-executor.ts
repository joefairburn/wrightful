/**
 * The dev/test `MonitorExecutor` (`WRIGHTFUL_MONITOR_EXECUTOR=stub`). Imports
 * `void/db` (via the ingest lib) so it is INTEGRATION-only — no unit test (the
 * harness's `void/db` stub throws on use); the full schedule → queue → ingest
 * pipeline is exercised against it without Docker / a Void Sandbox.
 *
 * It synthesizes the SAME linkage a real container produces: a `runs` row whose
 * `idempotencyKey === execution.id`, `origin = "synthetic"`, `monitorId` set,
 * carrying a couple of fake tests, then resolves the produced `runId` + maps the
 * run's terminal status to a monitor `state` through the shared `run-linking`
 * helpers — so the consumer downstream of `MonitorExecutor.execute` cannot tell
 * a stub run from a container run.
 *
 * Outcome is deterministic and content-driven: a monitor whose `source`
 * contains the sentinel `FORCE_FAIL` synthesizes a failing run (state `fail`);
 * otherwise a passing one (state `pass`). It NEVER returns `infraError` — the
 * stub always "runs", so the consumer always acks; the infra-error/retry branch
 * is the SandboxExecutor's territory.
