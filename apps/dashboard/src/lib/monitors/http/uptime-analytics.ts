/**
 * Analytics SQL for the HTTP (uptime) monitor detail page — DB-bound (imports

 *   - {@link httpResponseTimeBuckets}: per-hour p50/p95 response time over a
 *     window, for the response-time trend chart. Reuses `percentilePick` (the
 *     discrete-percentile idiom) over an hourly partition.
 *   - {@link httpUptimeWindows}: pass+degraded ("up") vs countable counts over
 *     24h / 7d / 30d, for real time-based uptime % (vs the count-based last-N
 *     window the `ExecStrip` uses).
 *
 * Both mirror `uptimeFromExecutions`'s rule — `pass` AND `degraded` are up;
 * `running`/`error` are excluded from the denominator (infra, not an outage).
 * Response time only counts executions that GOT a response (`statusCode` not
 * null), so a network-error/timeout fail (whose `durationMs` is the time-to-
 * failure) doesn't distort the latency trend.
