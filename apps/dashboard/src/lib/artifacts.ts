/**
 * Artifact write pipeline — the storage half of the streaming ingest contract.
 *
 * This mirrors `ingest.ts` for artifacts: the route handlers under
 * `routes/api/artifacts/*` are auth + translation only, and the
 * verify-ownership -> idempotency-lookup -> size-check -> R2 write pipeline
 * lives here behind `registerArtifacts` / `storeArtifactUpload`. Every
 * read/write carries `scope.projectId` for logical tenant isolation, the same
 * as the run pipeline.
 *
 * Bytes traverse the worker BY DEFAULT: `registerArtifacts` hands back a
 * relative worker upload URL (`/api/artifacts/:id/upload`), and
 * `storeArtifactUpload` streams the PUT body through the worker into R2 via
 * `storage.put`. When the direct-R2 path is configured (`r2DirectEnabled` —
 * the four `R2_*` S3-API creds), `registerArtifacts` instead returns a
 * SigV4-presigned PUT URL (via the injected `signPut`) so bytes go straight to
 * R2 and the worker leaves the data path. See ADR-0003.
 *
 * Orphan-row invariant (documented once, here): registration writes a row per
 * artifact EAGERLY — a row's existence is a *promise to upload*. A failed PUT
 * leaves an orphan row whose download endpoint will 404. This is acceptable for
 * v1; the alternative (two-phase reserve/commit) is not worth the complexity at
 * this scale.
