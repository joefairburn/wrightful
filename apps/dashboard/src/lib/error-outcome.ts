/**
 * Pure error-gate policy for `middleware/00.errors.ts`.
 *
 * The error middleware has two irreducible entry conditions for the *same*
 * exception — a thrown `Response` propagates out of `next()` (the catch arm),
 * while an `Error`/`HTTPException` is swallowed by Hono into `c.res` before
 * `next()` unwinds (the post-next() arm). Each arm previously re-encoded the
 * identical 401/404/5xx decision table and the identical "log this API
 * failure?" predicate, so a policy change had to be mirrored across two or
 * three look-alike-but-not-interchangeable spots.
 *
 * This module concentrates both policies as pure functions so the two arms
 * differ only in *how they obtain the status* (`extractStatus(err)` vs
 * `c.res?.status`) — not in what they decide. The middleware shell keeps the
 * try/catch + post-next() duality; everything below is side-effect free and
 * unit-tested.
