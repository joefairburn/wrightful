/**
 * The Postgres data layer for test ownership (roadmap 2.3) — the deep module the
 * flaky page badge join and the owner-gated session mutations speak to.
 *
 * Like `quarantine-repo`, every query carries `projectId` for logical tenant
 * isolation — there is no DO boundary, so scoping each query by the branded
 * `TenantScope` projectId (or a passed, already-auth-checked projectId on the
 * trusted-id reader) is what keeps an ownership row from leaking across
 * projects. Ids are ULIDs; timestamps are epoch SECONDS, matching the rest of
 * the schema.
 *
 * Ownership is LAYERED: manual `testOwners` rows are the source of truth and
 * override the CODEOWNERS-derived set. `resolveTestOwners` computes the union
 * with that precedence (`mergeOwners` is the pure rule); the CODEOWNERS leg is
 * derived on the fly from `projects.codeownersFile` (matched against each
 * test's latest `file`), not persisted.
