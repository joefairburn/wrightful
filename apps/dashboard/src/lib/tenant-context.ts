 * The two shapes every `/t/:teamSlug/p/:projectSlug/*` loader needs:
 *  - `project`: the rich, auth-checked active project (slug, name, role,
 *    teamName) for rendering.
 *  - `scope`: the same project re-expressed as a `TenantScope` with branded
 *    ids, for use in any `runs / testResults / testTags / testAnnotations /
 *    testResultAttempts / artifacts` query.
 *
 * Both are derived from `c.var.activeProject`, populated once per request by
 * `middleware/01.context.ts` (one indexed `memberships ⋈ teams ⟕ projects`
 * join). Loaders previously re-ran that join inline — see git history for
 * the migration.
