/**
 * Two-axis data retention sweep.
 *
 * Enforces two independent, separately-configurable windows because their
 * cost/value profiles differ:
 *
 *   - **Artifact bytes** (`retentionArtifactDays`, default 30) — the R2 storage
 *     cost. Expired artifacts have their R2 objects AND rows deleted.
 *   - **testResults rows** (`retentionTestResultsDays`, default 90) — the
 *     Postgres row-storage cost. Expired testResults are deleted; the FK cascade
 *     removes their attempts/tags/annotations/artifact ROWS. `runs` summary rows
 *     are kept (the aggregate counters live there), so run history outlives its
 *     detail.
 *
 * Modeled on the stale-run watchdog (`sweepStaleRuns`): a bounded slice per
 * project per pass (`limit`) so a large backlog drains across successive daily
 * passes rather than blowing the Workers subrequest budget. Per-project (not
 * global) so each query rides the `(projectId, createdAt)` index, and so each
 * project picks up its team's window.
 *
 * Orphan-free by construction: the artifact-age pass deletes R2 objects before
 * rows, and the testResults pass ALSO deletes the R2 objects of the artifacts it
 * is about to cascade-delete — so an expiring testResult never strands live R2
 * bytes, regardless of window config or an artifact-sweep backlog.

 * SELECTs but does NOT consume a chunk. Without this, a deployment with more
 * projects than the chunk ceiling had its budget eaten by idle probes on the head
 * of the list, so the tail was swept LATE or never (unbounded-retention bug for
 * those tenants). The wall-clock deadline (still checked every project) remains
 * the hard bound that terminates an all-idle-but-slow scan. Fairness across
