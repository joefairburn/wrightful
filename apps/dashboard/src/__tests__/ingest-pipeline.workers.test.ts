/**
 * The ingest pipeline's three run-scoped entry points — `openRun`,
 * `appendRunResults`, `completeRun` — ARE the deep module: each hides
 * verify-ownership -> resolve ids -> compose a heterogeneous `db.transaction` ->
 * extract the summary from the LAST statement's row -> bump team activity ->
 * broadcast. The leaf pure helpers (computeAggregateDelta, mergeRunStatus,
 * buildChangedTests, summaryFromBatchResults, reconcileAndBroadcast) each have
 * their own unit suite, but the *orchestration glue that wires them together*
 * — that the no-delta path swaps the delta UPDATE for a liveness-bump UPDATE,
 * that ownership returns notFound, that the duplicate-open path still prefills this shard's
 * queued rows, that appendRunResults feeds prevStatus -> delta -> the broadcast
 * summary — was reachable only by booting a real run end-to-end.
 *
 * The first concrete consumer of the still-unbuilt real-Postgres harness is the
 * deepest, highest-blast-radius module: this file. Rather than stand up a whole
 * pglite/Postgres binding (the pipeline's atomicity boundary is a real
 * `db.transaction`), we reuse the project's established mock-the-PG-boundary
 * idiom (see db-batch.test.ts): mock `void/db` so the query builders are
 * controllable thenables and `db.transaction` runs the builder against a
 * recording tx executor, and mock `@/realtime/publish`'s room broadcasters. That
 * makes the orchestration reachable and pins these invariants:
 *   - openRun: duplicate idempotencyKey returns { duplicate: true } WITHOUT a
 *     fresh runs insert, but still prefills this shard's planned rows;
 *   - appendRunResults: the delta UPDATE is appended LAST in the transaction on
 *     a real delta, swapped for a liveness-bump UPDATE on a no-op delta, and the
 *     broadcast summary is exactly txResults[last][0];
 *   - completeRun / appendRunResults: ownership miss returns { kind: "notFound" }
 *     with no transaction and no broadcast.
 * The Postgres transaction's atomicity (durable decision #10) lives at the
 * boundary and is out of scope; this covers the assembly/ordering/summary-
 * extraction glue — the part the pure-helper suites cannot reach.

// ─── Controllable void/db mock ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every builder method returns the SAME chainable node so chains like
// `db.select(c).from(t).where(w).limit(1)` and `db.update(t).set(s).where(w)
// .returning(cols)` resolve to one statement object. Each node is also a
// thenable, and resolves its rows differently depending on which executor built
// it:
//   - statements built off the pooled `db` (the idempotency/ownership SELECTs,
//     resolveTestResultIds' SELECT, bumpTeamActivity's UPDATE) dequeue from the
//     `awaitResults` FIFO when awaited directly;
//   - statements built off the transaction executor `tx` (the prefill INSERT,
//     the per-test upsert/replace, the usage bump, and the summary UPDATE) are
//     awaited IN ORDER by `runBatch`'s `for (const stmt of build(tx))` loop and
//     each resolves to `txStatementResult` — the per-statement row-set the
//     transaction yields. The pipeline reads ONLY the LAST statement's result as
//     the broadcast summary (txResults[last][0]), and the intermediate writes'
//     results are unread; returning the SAME configured value for every tx
//     statement therefore pins the summary contract without coupling the fixture
//     to the (production-internal) write-statement COUNT. Awaiting a tx statement
//     also RECORDS it (in await order) into `txStatements`, the array the
//     assertions inspect — replacing the old `db.batch` call-args, since Postgres
//     builds each statement against `tx` and runs them inside `db.transaction`
//     rather than handing an array to `batch`.
//
// `runBatch` is Postgres-only now: it calls `db.transaction(fn)` and runs each
// statement inside it (NO `db.batch`). So the boundary spy here is
// `transactionSpy`, and the fake `db` exposes `.transaction`, not `.batch`.
