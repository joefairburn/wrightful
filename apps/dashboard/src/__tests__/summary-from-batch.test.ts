/**
 * Guards the summary-extraction convention shared by appendRunResults /
 * completeRun / finalizeStaleRun: the summary-producing statement (a
 * `.returning()` UPDATE or `aggregateSummarySelectStatement` SELECT) is always
 * run LAST in the batch, so the broadcast summary is `batchResults[last][0]`.
 *
 * Before this seam existed each caller hand-transcribed `batchResults[len-1] as
 * RunAggregateSummary[] | undefined` then `?.[0]`. A trailing non-returning
 * statement (or an off-by-one) made that read `undefined`, silently publishing
 * the wrong row (or, in appendRunResults, returning a spurious notFound). These
 * tests pin the positional read + null-normalization in its one home.
 *
 * The `db.batch` round-trip (append-last + transaction) in `runBatchWithSummary`
 * needs the real-D1 harness to assert end-to-end; this covers the pure
 * extraction half that holds the footgun.
