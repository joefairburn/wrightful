/**
 * `reconcileAndBroadcast` (`@/lib/ingest`) owns the terminal recompute-and-
 * broadcast tail shared by `completeRun` and `finalizeStaleRun`. Before this
 * seam each terminal path hand-transcribed the same three steps: append a single
 * `aggregateRecomputeStatement` LAST, run it with the caller's status-flip in one
 * transaction, then `if (summary) broadcastRunUpdate(runId, [], summary)`. The two
 * shared the "recompute is the last statement → its `.returning()` row is the
 * broadcast summary" invariant by COPY (the cron docstring even acknowledged the
 * mirror). If completeRun's tail drifted, finalizeStaleRun would silently
 * broadcast a stale/absent summary — caught by nothing. This concentrates the
 * tail so the invariant lives in one place.
 *
 * The real Postgres transaction is unmockable in the vitest harness (the
 * `void/db` stub's `db` Proxy throws on access), so we mock `db.transaction` +
 * the query builders and `@/realtime/publish` (the `void/ws` room broadcasters)
 * to assert the pure orchestration contract:
 *   - the caller's status-update is FIRST and the recompute is appended LAST,
 *   - the summary broadcast to the run room (`run:<runId>`) is the LAST batch
 *     result's first row (transactionally consistent with the recompute), with
 *     empty changedTests, and the same summary flips the project-room row,
 *   - no broadcast when the recompute matched no row (run vanished mid-flight),
 *   - the merged summary is returned to the caller either way,
 *   - with `requireStatusFlip`, a no-op finalize (FIRST element's
 *     affected-row count `0`) is silent — no redundant broadcast — while a real
 *     flip still broadcasts, and the guard is OFF for completeRun.
 * The atomicity guarantee itself lives at the Postgres boundary and is out of
 * scope.

// runBatch (Postgres) runs the builder's statements inside `db.transaction(fn)`:

// and awaits each, so its returned `out` IS the ordered per-statement results
// array the callers index into.

// so awaiting it reproduces that result and — on await, which runBatch does in
