/**
 * Guards the status → aggregate-bucket mapping that two code paths must agree
 * on: the JS delta path (`statusBucket` → `computeAggregateDelta`, run on every
 * /results batch) and the SQL recompute path (`aggregateRecomputeStatement`'s
 * five `COUNT(*) WHERE status …` subqueries, run on /complete). Before this
 * suite the two encodings were hand-kept in sync; now both derive from
 * `STATUS_BUCKET_MEMBERS`, and these tests pin that single source of truth so a
 * mis-edit (e.g. dropping `timedout` from the failed bucket) fails here instead
 * of silently corrupting production aggregates.
 *
 * The recompute UPDATE itself can't be rendered to SQL under the void/db stub
 * (`db` is a throwing Proxy), so the structural parity is asserted via the
 * shared constant the recompute builds from — see aggregateRecomputeStatement.
