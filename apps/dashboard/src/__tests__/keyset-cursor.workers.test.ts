/**
 * The shared keyset-cursor wire codec behind `decodeCursor` /
 * `decodeRankedCursor` (`run-results-page.ts`) and `decodeGroupCursor`
 * (`run-groups-page.ts`). These tests pin the ONE uniform malformed→null rule
 * the three hand-rolled decoders had drifted on — notably the empty leading
 * segment, which the group decoder used to accept (`":key"` silently decoded
 * to severity 0). Per-caller numeric coercion / final-segment rules are pinned
 * by the callers' own tests.
