/**
 * `runScopeWhere` / `runByIdWhere` are the single owners of the tenant
 * predicate for the `runs` table — the shape ~10 readers/writers used to
 * hand-roll. Under the void/db stub, operators record their arguments
 * (`{ __op, args }`), so we can read back the EXACT predicate each helper
 * emits and pin the two invariants the finding is about:
 *
 *  1. `runScopeWhere` ANDs BOTH `teamId` AND `projectId` (the denormalized
 *     defense-in-depth pair), bound to the scope's auth-checked ids — not just
 *     one of them, and never a raw string.
 *  2. `runByIdWhere` ANDs `projectId` AND `id` (the run-by-id lookup shape),
 *     so a leaked run id can't be read outside its project.
 *
 * If a future edit drops a column (e.g. forgets `teamId`, or scopes a
 * by-id lookup on `id` alone) these tests fail — which is the whole point of
 * concentrating the predicate behind one seam.
