/**
 * `signArtifactRows` (via the exported `loadAttemptArtifactGroups`) mints a
 * signed, token-authed WORKER download href per row — never the raw `r2Key`.
 * Replayable trace rows get the longer token through the shared artifact
 * lifetime policy (the viewer's SW range-reads the zip lazily for the whole
 * modal session).
 *
 * This seam does NOT mint a self-hosted trace-viewer URL. It used to (a
 * `traceViewerUrl` field on `SignedArtifact`/`ArtifactAction`), but the
 * field's only consumers — the rail button and replay dialog — used it only
 * as a presence gate. Those consumers now apply the shared replay predicate
 * to the complete artifact and derive the viewer link from `href`. The URL's
 * shape (same-origin, never `trace.playwright.dev`) is covered directly in
 * `artifact-tokens.workers.test.ts`, not here.
