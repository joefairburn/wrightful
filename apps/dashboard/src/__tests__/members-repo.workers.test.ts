/**
 * The last-owner invariant (roadmap 3.1): demoting or removing a team's sole
 * owner must be impossible, and race-safely so. Two race shapes (see the
 * `members-repo` module doc):
 *
 *  - same-row race: closed by the owner-count guard inside the UPDATE/DELETE
 *    WHERE (`notLastOwner`), never a separate check-then-write;
 *  - cross-row write-skew (two owners demoting/removing each other): closed by
 *    locking the team's owner rows first (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) inside a
 *    `db.transaction`, before the guarded write runs on the same `tx`.
 *
 * These pin both: that `notLastOwner` is carried into the statement with the
 * right shape, and that the owner-row lock fires ahead of the write for
 * demote/remove/leave (skipped for promote-to-owner).
 *
 * The stub records operator calls as `{ __op, args }` and captures each
 * top-level `tx` call as an ordered `Call` (its `.where`, `.orderBy`,
 * `.for("update")`), so tests read the guard predicate back out and assert the
 * lock-then-write order. `db.transaction(fn)` invokes `fn` with that same `tx`.
 * Each call's awaited result comes from a per-test queue consumed in call order
 * (the lock consumes one slot too), driving the row-updated / guard-blocked /
 * row-vanished branches.
