 * chart). The Tests-tab group list is NOT loaded here — it loads client-side
 * behind a skeleton via TanStack (`RunProgress`), so the page shell + header +
 * filter chips paint immediately and the group list streams in on demand,
 * matching the deferred-load pattern used elsewhere on the page.
 *
 * The page subscribes via `useRunRoom(runId)`: the summary (from `run.*`) drives
 * the live filter chips, and live `changedTests` merge into loaded groups.
