 * Per-test history page. Unlike the run-scoped result detail
 * (`runs/:runId/tests/:testResultId`), this is keyed by the stable `testId`
 * and answers "how has THIS test behaved over time?" — independent of any one
 * run.
 *
 * The header paints from one cheap eager read: the most-recent (non-synthetic)
 * result for the testId — an index-served `ORDER BY createdAt DESC LIMIT 1`
 * (not a history scan) that doubles as the existence probe and supplies the
 * title/describe-chain/file/latest-status.
 *
 * Two groups stream behind skeletons, each its own `defer()` so neither gates
 * the other or the header:
 *   - `stats`: all-time aggregate (counts, avg/p95 duration, first/last seen)
 *     for the KPI strip. The expensive one — `percentile_cont(0.95)` sorts
 *     every retained row — hence no longer gating the header/existence.
 *   - `details`: recent `HISTORY_LIMIT` results joined to runs (chart +
 *     recent-runs table), tag union, quarantine state, owners + (for owners)
 *     assignable members. One `defer()` so they resolve together.
 *
 * Every read scopes by `projectId` (branded `TenantScope`) per logical
 * tenancy. No result → `kind: "not_found"` (friendly page), not a 404 Response.
 *
 * Plain `defineHandler` (not `withValidator`) — REQUIRED for `defer()`:
 * `withValidator` awaits/serializes the handler return, collapsing a `Deferred`
 * prop into a plain object so the client's `use()` throws.
