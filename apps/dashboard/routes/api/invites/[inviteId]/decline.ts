 * POST /api/invites/:inviteId/decline
 *
 * Soft-decline by deleting the invite. The caller must be the invite's
 * intended recipient — matched by VERIFIED email (`buildInviteMatchConds`).
 * Without this binding any signed-in user could enumerate invite ids and burn
 * other users' invites. GitHub-login-directed invites aren't declinable here
 * for the same reason they aren't acceptable here (the login is mutable; see
 * auth-users.ts) — they're redeemed/ignored via the `/invite/:token` link.
 *
 * We don't keep a "declined" tombstone because directed invites are
 * re-issuable — an admin who wants the user back can just send a fresh one.
