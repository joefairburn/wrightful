/**
 * GET /api/github/setup — the GitHub App "Setup URL" callback.
 *
 * After a team owner installs the App (via the link on the team settings page,
 * which carries `state=<teamSlug>`), GitHub redirects here with `installation_id`
 * + `state`. We resolve the team from `state`, require the signed-in user be its
 * owner, prove the user administers `installation_id` on GitHub's side, look up
 * the installation's account login (the repo-owner resolution key), and persist
 * the link. Row creation lives here — not the webhook — because only this flow
 * knows which Wrightful team the installation belongs to.
 *
 * Security (H1): `state` and `installation_id` are both attacker-suppliable, so
 * the owner gate proves nothing about the installation — a signed-in owner of a
 * throwaway team could otherwise claim any unlinked installation id and drive
 * that org's repos via check runs. `verifyUserAdministersInstallation` (below)
 * is the barrier: it asks GitHub, with the user's own OAuth token, whether the
 * id is one they may administer. Do not remove it.
