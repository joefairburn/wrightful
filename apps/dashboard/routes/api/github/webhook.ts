/**
 * POST /api/github/webhook — GitHub App webhook receiver.
 *
 * NOT a bearer-authenticated ingest route (so `middleware/02.api-auth.ts` lets
 * it through to here): it self-authenticates via the `X-Hub-Signature-256`
 * HMAC over the raw body, exactly as the artifact download route self-auths via
 * its signed `?t=` token.
 *
 * v1 acts only on `installation.deleted` — remove the link so a stale
 * installation never gets a check posted. Row CREATION is owned by the setup
 * callback (`routes/api/github/setup.ts`), which knows the Wrightful team from
 * the install `state`; the `installation.created` event carries no team context,
 * so it's acknowledged and ignored.
