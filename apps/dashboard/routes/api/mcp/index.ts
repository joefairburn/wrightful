/**
 * /api/mcp — the Wrightful MCP server endpoint (Model Context Protocol,
 * Streamable HTTP transport).
 *
 * TWO ways for an agent to connect:
 *
 *   1. OAuth (interactive agents — Claude Code, Cursor, …). Add the server
 *      with no credentials; the first 401 carries a `WWW-Authenticate:
 *      Bearer resource_metadata=…` challenge, the client discovers the
 *      Better Auth authorization server via the root `/.well-known/*`
 *      documents (rewritten in void.json), dynamically registers, and runs
 *      the browser authorize → login → consent flow. The resulting access
 *      token is USER-scoped: tools take team/project slugs, membership-checked
 *      per call (`McpAuthz` kind "user").
 *
 *        claude mcp add --transport http wrightful https://<dashboard>/api/mcp
 *
 *   2. A project API key (headless/CI). Same Bearer header the reporter and
 *      `/api/v1/*` use; the server is hard-bound to the key's project
 *      (`McpAuthz` kind "project").
 *
 *        claude mcp add --transport http wrightful https://<dashboard>/api/mcp \
 *          --header "Authorization: Bearer <key>"
 *
 * `middleware/02.api-auth.ts` (via `isMcpRoute` / `requireMcpAuthOrResponse`)
 * validates whichever credential is present and stashes `apiKey` OR `mcpAuth`;
 * `middleware/03.rate-limit.ts` throttles per key/user under
 * `QUERY_RATE_LIMITER`. There is no `X-Wrightful-Version` handshake; MCP
 * negotiates its own protocol version inside JSON-RPC.
 *
 * STATELESS mode: a fresh `McpServer` + transport per request, no
 * `Mcp-Session-Id` minted (`sessionIdGenerator: undefined`) and plain JSON
 * responses (`enableJsonResponse`) instead of a hanging SSE stream. This is
 * the shape that fits Workers — an isolate can't promise a later request
 * lands on the same instance, and every tool is a self-contained read, so
 * there is no per-session state worth keeping. GET (the server-push SSE
 * channel) and DELETE (session termination) are meaningless without sessions,
 * so this route answers them with the spec's 405 ITSELF — `@hono/mcp`'s
 * transport would instead hold a GET open as an eternal keepalive-pinged SSE
 * stream that a stateless server never writes to (one dangling Workers
 * request per curious client). Guarded by the e2e 405 test.
 *
 * The tool surface itself lives in `src/lib/mcp/server.ts` — this handler is
 * auth-shape resolution + transport only, mirroring the ingest routes'
 * "routes are translation, libs are the module" convention.
