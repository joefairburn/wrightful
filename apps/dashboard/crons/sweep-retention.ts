/**
 * Two-axis data-retention sweep: every 6 hours, delete artifacts (R2 objects +
 * rows) and testResults rows that have aged past their team's retention
 * windows. See `sweepRetention` (`@/lib/retention`) for the bounded per-project
 * policy and the orphan-free R2 cleanup.
 *
 * Distinct cron expression (every 6 hours) so it never collides with the
 * five-minute reaper family or the daily usage rollup — Void dispatches crons
 * via `switch(controller.cron)`, so two files must never share an expression.
 * Retention is not latency-sensitive; a low frequency keeps the bounded backlog
 * draining without competing with the hot reapers.
