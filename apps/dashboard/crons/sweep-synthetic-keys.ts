/**
 * Backstop sweeper for orphaned synthetic-monitor ingest keys. The
 * `SandboxExecutor` revokes each per-run key in its `finally`, but that is
 * best-effort — a Worker evicted / CPU-killed mid-run skips it — and
 * `validateApiKey` enforces no time-based expiry, so an orphaned key would stay
 * a permanently-valid project-scoped Bearer credential. Every 5 minutes this
 * hard-deletes any `synthetic-monitor:*` key older than the execution-stale
 * window whose owning execution is no longer in flight.
 *
 * The cutoff reuses `WRIGHTFUL_MONITOR_EXECUTION_STALE_MINUTES` so the two
 * sweeps share one notion of "stale"; the in-flight guard itself is the NOT
 * EXISTS on the owning execution inside `sweepStaleSyntheticKeys` — age alone
 * races the execution lifecycle (a key minted late in the window can still be
 * live ingest auth when it crosses the cutoff). Thin adapter over
 * `sweepStaleSyntheticKeys` (`@/lib/monitors/synthetic-key`); the bounded
 * `.limit` keeps a mass-orphan event from blowing one tick's budget.
