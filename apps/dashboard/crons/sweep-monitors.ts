/**
 * Synthetic-monitor scheduler: every minute, find the enabled monitors whose
 * `nextRunAt` is due and enqueue one `MonitorJob` per due monitor — ROUTED by
 * the monitor's type: the lightweight uptime family (`http`, plus `tcp`/`ping` —
 * a raw socket connect, batched) goes to the `uptime` queue; browser jobs to the
 * `monitors` queue (one Void Sandbox container per job). The job body is IDs-only
 * either way; the sweep already holds the monitor row, so the type-routing is
 * free.
 *
 * Minute granularity is the floor Cloudflare cron offers and matches the
 * 60-second floor of `MONITOR_INTERVAL_PRESETS` (the hardcoded allowed
 * intervals in `@/lib/monitors/monitor-schemas`) — a monitor can fire at most
 * once per tick.
 *
 * The whole select-due-slice → plan → persist-in-one-batch → enqueue policy
 * lives behind `sweepDueMonitors` (`@/lib/monitors/scheduler`), mirroring how
 * `sweep-stuck-runs.ts` delegates to `sweepStaleRuns`. This cron is a thin
 * adapter: it computes `now` (epoch seconds), maps env config in
 * (`WRIGHTFUL_MONITOR_SWEEP_BATCH_SIZE` is the per-tick `.limit` budget that
 * keeps a project with hundreds of armed monitors from blowing one tick's
 * subrequest budget — the backlog drains oldest-due-first across ticks), wires
 * the producer (`queues.monitors.send`) as the enqueue fn, and logs the tally.
